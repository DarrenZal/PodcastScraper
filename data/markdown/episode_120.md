## About Biochar

Biochar is a form of charcoal that can be made from a variety of organic material, including woody biomass, corn stover, hemp stalks, and even cattle manure. Like charcoal, the char is made through a process called pyrolysis in which oxygen is limited, causing the biomass to smolder. The process creates substantial micro-tubule caverns in the material, resulting in a sponge-like, water absorbing, and soil micro-organism habitat that boosts soil building and carbon sequestration performance substantially. One gram of biochar is estimated to have 200 to 300 square meters of surface area as a result of this capillary porosity. Although precision technology is emerging to make biochar on a massive scale world-wide, the technique is an ancient one, made for centuries by pre-contact indigenous societies in Amazonia (such biochar is known as Terra Preta), and by many other folk and indigenous peoples around the planet. Now with the world-wide activation of robust carbon credit markets, and increasing demand for such credits from a variety of corporate and philanthropic buyers, biochar production is poised to scale exponentially, and could be capable of sequestering one gigaton (one billion tons) of atmospheric carbon annually.

Welcome to the YonEarth community podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. Today we’re

in Laramie, Wyoming, recording with Rowdy Yeatts, the founder of High Flames Biochar.

Hi Rowdy. How do you guys? Glad to be here. Yeah man, really excited to talk with you today.

Absolutely, absolutely. We’ve got a lot to cover with biochar, agricultural uses, carbon sequestration,

a whole set of intersecting issues coming together right here at what you’re doing as an inventor,

an entrepreneur and the technology maker. Perfect, that’s great. Yeah. Rowdy Yeatts is originally from

Casper, Wyoming. He went to high school in college in Oklahoma, graduating from Oklahoma State

University with a business degree. He always had an interest in building and metal fabrication and

owned a boat.construction business in Oklahoma. He also lived in Texas and Nebraska, the latter,

being the place where High Flames Biochar was founded. Now we’re here looking at fast forwarding

a few years. The Rocket Char 301 technology you’re going to hear a lot about that is one of the

latest and greatest of High Flames offerings. In 2021, they built the first working pilot unit

and went through a Microsoft Funded Accelerator called G Beta. And then in 2022, they were chosen

for a United States Department of Energy Technology Accelerator called Reach, which is run by Colorado

State University and Industry Ventures in Fort Collins, Colorado. Earlier this year, 2022,

Kevin Johnson joined the team and is helping Rowdy now as they’re accelerating and scaling up

the technology and also working to create the world’s first biochar cooperative where participating

members can verify and sell the carbon credits coming from the biochar production that the

group is responsible for. And that project is being created in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain

Farmers Union. So we’ve got a lot to talk about here Rowdy and we’ll help explain what some of this

means to those in our audience who maybe aren’t quite as familiar. But let us just jump right in

and I’ll ask you, what is biochar and what’s the big deal about biochar right now?

Oh, biochar. What is biochar? The really cool thing about biochar is most of you have actually made

biochar and don’t even realize it. So if you’ve had a campfire and ever found large chunks of charcoal

in the pit after the next morning, you’ve actually made biochar yourself. If you’ve ever burned

toast in your toaster, you’ve actually made biochar yourself. So believe it or not, you’ve actually

made biochar. But in simple terms, biochar is charcoal created from cooking biomass at high temperatures

in the absence of oxygen. We typically use wood chips, but there’s a lot of other feedstocks that

you can use to make biochar with. And what are the properties of biochar that are making it such an

important potential application in soil and even in other agricultural uses? What’s it doing?

You know, I think the neat thing about biochar is the longevity of it. So it’s carbon that we

can add to our soil, but it lasts for thousands of years, which is much different than a lot of the

other short term soil amendments that are used. So that’s really the big difference between biochar

and a lot of the other soil amendments that are out there. And that’s also how we can sequester carbon.

So a tree can pull carbon out of the atmosphere. We turn that wood into a stable form of carbon that

lasts for thousands of years in the soil. And that’s how we’re able to work with nature and actually

remove carbon from the atmosphere. Yeah, it’s really interesting. And I know a lot of our farming and

gardening friends and colleagues are really excited about what biochar is doing in the soil as

the soil amendment for the plants and the water retention. Can you explain to us what’s going on

there in terms of the properties as well? Absolutely. I think for that we really need to go back

thousands of years to where the ancient Amazonians were creating terapreta, where they were adding

charcoal and different things to the soils to grow more food for these large civilizations.

And that’s how they were able to improve the soil health to the point where they could actually

grow large amounts of food on fairly small parts of land. And now fast forward several thousand

years and we’re essentially rediscovering this ancient technology that the Amazonians knew.

But now we have new technologies for making biochar like the rocket char 301. And we have a lot of

other really unique applications where biochar is being used. One meet when that we’re refocus on

is using biochar and animal feed. There are other projects that are adding biochar to asphalt projects.

So there’s just really a lot of neat uses around biochar right now.

Yeah, when it’s used as an animal feed, what is it doing to benefit the animals and or benefit

the climate situation? Yeah, I think to start with, in simple terms, the biochar is helping to

pass toxins. So a lot of the feed that animals eat in jest right now, they’ve been sprayed

with different chemicals, the different haze, the different range of their eating. And so these

chemicals build up in their digestive system. And the first thing the biochar does is it removes

those toxins from the digestive system. We’ve also seen benefits as far as increased milk output

in dairies. We’ve done some research with the University of Nebraska doing a feed trial where we’re

actually able to reduce the methane output from cattle by about 10 to 15 percent. So essentially

removing the burps, which was surprising to me, I always assumed that the methane production came

out the other end of the cow, but apparently a lot of the methane actually comes out the the

burp side of the cow. No kidding. Yeah, that’s new to me too, actually, you’re ready.

And what about asphalt when biochar is used in asphalt, how is it improving performance there?

You know, there’s some really interesting stuff. I’m not an expert in the biochar and asphalt,

but I’ve watched a few webinars on it. It sounds like that the biochar itself makes for

a asphalt that can be applied at lower temperatures. But I think the big benefit for adding

the biochar to the asphalt is the carbon aspect of it. We’re able to have these paving projects where

we’re actually sequestering carbon from the atmosphere while we’re paving our streets. And that’s

a really interesting aspect to me, but I think there are some chemical properties that make the

biochar as far as the temperature and the longevity of the asphalt improves by adding the biochar.

Very interesting. Now, you know, I’ve had a hand, I have burnt some toast in the past, I will

cop to that, but you’ve had a handful of wonderful campfires over the years. And, you know,

when we get them burned in nice and hot, we tend to end up with just ash at the end. And I’m

wondering, could you just describe for us technically and up here behind us, you can see the window

into the unit is actually burning now. You might be able to see the flames there through the window

if you’re looking at the video. Can you explain to us what’s going on with this combustion that we’re

not just ending up with ash and we’re actually left with this really useful biochar product?

Correct. In a noble campfire situation, the wood oxygen is in contact with it and eventually

it turns into ash. You might find some charcoal kind of tucked in the corners in the back area,

or if you put your fire out before it’s done, you will obviously have some charcoal there. But

in this case, what we’re doing, we’re running at about 1200 degrees. So inside, behind that window,

it’s 1200 degrees. And what we’re doing is we’re heating that wood waste up, but in the absence

of oxygen. So it’s inside of a reactor tube so that we’re able to non-allow that oxygen to come

in contact with the wood. And that’s how we create the biochar. It’s high temperature in the

absence of oxygen, which is called pyrolysis. Yeah, and with this pyrolysis, I understand the

output is not only a form of carbon that’s going to stay very stable in the ground or whatever

other application it’s put into, but that also there’s a whole bunch of porous, almost like sponge

like surface area created inside of the char itself. And can you explain us what the increased

surface area is and what that’s going to do for things like soil, water retention, etc.

Absolutely. So the carbon structure of biochar, it’s a very high carbon product, but if you look

closely under a microscope, but you’ll actually see it’s hollow carbon tubes. And that is the

surface area where one gram of biochar can typically have two to 300 square meters of surface area,

just in one gram, which is really just mind boggling. But what that is in the soil is housing

for microbes. It gives them a structure to thrive in. They really like getting inside those hollow

carbon tubes and setting up shop essentially. So it’s apartment complexes for our soil microbes

and fungi and protozoa and all the other life going on in our soil. Well, that’s really important

and amazing. And especially in the more erad and semi-erad parts of the world, right, this becomes

part of the water conservation and water utilization strategy and food and herbal medicine production.

Is that something you’re seeing interest in from around the world?

Absolutely. By adding the biochar to the soils, we can reduce the amount of water that’s required

to grow those crops. And it can hold that moisture in the soil for more days. So when a normal soil

might dry out, a soil emitted with biochar might get two more days of available moisture to those

roots. And that can make a lot of difference in producing crops.

Yeah, wow, that’s significant. And speaking of crops, what are some of the inputs you had

mentioned? What are some of the other agricultural inputs that can be utilized to make the biochar?

Yeah, that’s really the neat thing about biochar. You have a lot of flexibility in what you can use.

So farms may have different crop residues, oat holes, corn residues, different things like that.

It might make a great feedstock. A hemp farmer might use a hemp flower after the CBD has been

extracted. A sawmill might have sawdust and other waste that they’re utilizing. So cities that

don’t have municipal urban waste available for a lot of their urban tree projects. So when you

start looking around, there’s biomass and possible feedstock for biochar, just about everywhere you look.

Yeah, it’s so interesting. Now, can you tell us, here’s the hot box. I can feel the heat coming off.

What’s going on here with the process logic system that you’ve developed?

Yeah, so this is a really neat project. Colorado State University helped us develop this control

box. And what this is doing is it’s controlling the temperature. So this little PID controller here,

we’re running out about 1190 degrees right now. And that’s controlling our temperature. We also

have controls for things like ignition, our bin vibrators, our draft inducers. We’re able to

control the speed of our fuel loggers and our biochar auger, which allows us to control the temperature

and the dwell time of our biochar. And then finally, we’re using a quench pump here to actually

stop that burning process and turn the biochar and steam activate the biochar to increase that

pore surface area. I remember you were saying about before we started recording how the quenching

process considerably enhances surface area. And when we’re looking at something like the activated

carbon that some folks will use, we’re at the very kind of extreme end of that surface area of

potential. We’re able to take a regular biochar and by steam quenching, we’re able to open those

pores up. Just a little bit more that increases our surface areas. We’re actually approaching the

surface area of some activated carbons without having to go through the typical activation process.

We’re just using the heat that we generate from the process for the Steve activation. So there’s

no extra energy consumed. Yeah, it’s amazing. And you were explaining also beforehand that this

theoretically could be producing its own electricity requirements so that these could be deployed

in very remote settings and not require any external or additional electricity input. Can you

explain to us how that would work? That’s correct. So basically this technology, one of the really

unique features of this technology is it doesn’t require a fan for moving air. That essentially makes

us the Prius of biochar technologies because of the low power consumption. And part of that also

means that these can run on very little electricity. And what our goal is is to create the first carbon

negative technology that runs on its own energy. No one’s ever done this before. And we feel like with

a thermoelectric generator utilizing the heat from the exhaust stack on this that we can actually do

that. This machine right now is only consuming about 1.2 amps of electricity while operating. So

it’s just this technology requires a very, very little electricity to operate, which is what makes

it different than all the other biochar technologies in the world. It’s amazing. And right next to the

room that we’re in currently, the structure where we’re in currently with the unit is your

machine shop. And then over there and you know you and I met I think something like five, six

years ago. I think that sounds about right. Been up once or twice this way. You’ve been down to

a couple of our Y on Earth events over the years. And it’s been so wonderful the way you’ve shown

up and shared and educated folks about the opportunities we have with biochar. But I’ve got to say

with what you’re able to do in your machine shop, Rowdy, it’s extraordinary. And you are really one

of these inventor entrepreneur types who has figured out a way to make this technology very simple,

very foolproof and requiring very little in the way of operational maintenance, right? So that

this can get deployed in communities, farms, places even all around the world, right? Where this is

going to bring a lot of different benefits into people’s lives. And I’d love to ask you, what are some

of the challenges that you’ve seen with other technologies that you’ve been able to kind of solve

out of this technology? And two part question, you know, where are you seeing a huge opportunity

for there to be great humanitarian impact deploying these units outside of the United States?

Yeah, you know, as far as the technologies go, there’s a need for more biochar technologies,

right now. A lot of the older technologies that are available aren’t super energy efficient,

so they require a lot of electricity to operate. A lot of them don’t utilize the heat that they’re

generating. A lot of them use fossil fuels for startup process. So there’s a lot of improvement

to be made in some of those technologies, and that’s kind of what we did. We just tried to keep

things simple, get right back to the basics, and if when we were engineering a things got

complicated, we just backed up and kept things simple. And that’s really what the difference is

in this technology. So as far as scaling out the technology, the sky’s the limit here because

this technology is small scale and can be used on a farm in India or a farm in Indiana. It really

disguise the limit as far as how many of these that we could actually deploy and make a difference.

Right now, this machine is removing about six pounds of carbon dioxide per hour from the

atmosphere. The average person emits about four tons of carbon dioxide per year as far as

they’re carbon footprint. This machine is enough to actually offset an entire person’s carbon

footprint for the year, just by operating this machine. Well, that’s amazing. And then you’re

getting all those additional ancillary benefits, emending soil and so on. Yes, you’ve got the heat

that you can utilize. So in colder climates that he can be utilized to heat a greenhouse,

heat a shot building, heat a house. You’re also getting the biochar to enhance your soil.

And then on top of that, there’s biochar carbon credits that are associated with producing

biochar that are worth about a hundred dollars a ton. So there’s usually three different

kind of income streams from utilizing a waste product and turning it into biochar.

Yeah, this whole carbon credit piece has really gotten exciting the last couple of years and

you know, going clear back to when I was in school looking at sustainability issues is about,

I don’t know, 25 years ago. For many, many years as you know, Rowdy, there’s been this kind of

background discussion of when the carbon markets come alive and when carbon’s pricing out and

we’re thinking maybe five dollars, maybe ten dollars a ton. And now here we are fast forward

a quarter century from when I was looking at this back in school. And by golly, we’ve got a very

active carbon market and we’re seeing some very exciting pricing signals coming from the global

carbon market. I’d love to hear from your perspective, how have you seen the picture with the

carbon trading evolve these last several years? And what’s your sense about the role biochar is

going to be playing over the next several years, the next couple of decades as a global community

here is responding to the very serious need to pull carbon out of the atmosphere.

Yeah, that’s really a unique thing. The way carbon credits have evolved and a lot of our soil

carbon credits have gotten popular. The only thing about biochar carbon credits is that biochar

can be weighed. It can be put in a bag and we can measure that much easier than we can measure

soil carbon, which takes a lot of testing over periods of years. So that’s really the beauty of

biochar carbon credits. The other beauty of biochar is that it lasts for thousands of years in the

soil. So it’s not just a very short term carbon removal, some of the carbon projects meant only

for 50 years or 100 years where we’re talking thousands of years. And that’s why biochar carbon

credits are worth so much, worth considerably more than other carbon credits as well. So we’re

most most carbon credits are worth 25 to 50 dollars a ton of biochar carbon credits are now worth

between $100 to $200 a ton just because of their longevity and because the ease of measuring and

documenting the removal of the carbon just by simply bagging and weighing the biochar versus having

to test soils or navigate some of those more difficult testing options. Yeah, that makes a lot

of sense. Now I’m not asking you to tell the future or peer into your crystal ball here, but

what’s your sense in terms of how the biochar carbon credit value is going to price over the coming

years. I think it’ll be pretty stable in that range or something else. I basically a lot of the

indications that we’re seeing is that the biochar carbon credits are going to continue to be a premium

carbon credit and demand a higher price on the marketplace just because of that longevity and

the simplicity of measuring them compared to some of the other methods. So it feels like biochar is

slowly gaining momentum and climbing gets away towards the top of kind of that list of the best

ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere for longer periods of time. Yeah, interesting. Now I know

a lot of our colleagues are working on other aspects of regenerative agricultural solutions that are

also sequestering carbon as you mentioned soil building. Is anybody yet piecing together? Hey,

when you add a ton of biochar to the soil, you’ve got that ton of carbon sequestered value,

but you’re also stimulating a lot of additional soil building activity more than likely.

Is anybody piecing that together yet as like an integrated strategy? Yeah, so I think there were

some studies out of Australia now that are in the past their five year since they began and we’re

starting to see that your right there was an initial boost from adding the biochar to the soil,

but it also accelerates further carbon sequestration in the soil. We’re part of a really unique project

that’s getting funded by USDA as part of their climate smart commodities program where we’re

going to be applying biochar with cover crop seed to see what kind of benefits we can have enhanced

with cover crops by adding the biochar to that. We’re going to be doing 3,000 acres over five years

in measuring those long-term effects. So we’re really excited about seeing some of these benefits

because that one of the long-term picture of what adding carbon to your soil does.

Yeah, that’s so exciting and I know we’ve been kicking around a few ideas and a few opportunities

for high-plains biochar and the YonEarth community to collaborate further. And one of the

one of the things that we’ve been discussing is this cooperative model that you’re putting together,

and I’d love to hear from you, Rowdy, if you’re looking out over the next several years and

this vision has come to full fruition, what does it look like? How can different communities,

different farmers be a part of this mechanism that you’re putting together that will allow all kinds

of folks to be a part of this major movement? Yeah, that’s the really neat thing about this

technology is what makes it so different is it’s much smaller scale than most of the really large

scale biochar technologies that cost millions of dollars where this is at a price point and at a

scale where this can be deployed at a farm anywhere in the world where we can have farmers in India

that are producing biochar we can have farmers in Europe that are producing biochar we can have

saw mills in the Midwest producing biochar and our goal is to deploy as much of this technology

around the world as possible get everyone producing biochar and the associated carbon credits

and then take all those carbon credits and put them together and market them as a group.

And that way we can take what’s really difficult for a small individual farmer to do on their own

and we can make that really easy because we’re doing it as such a large group.

Yeah, it’s so exciting. I just we’re working on some related things at the Wieners community

to help folks turn their yards into food forests and permacultures and you know soil building

is such a big part of this and I’m just thrilled that we’re at living in a time right now where

there’s so much innovation and so much opportunity for us to you know lock arms and have a lot

of positive impact by collaborating together and I’m really excited about what you’re up to

Rowdy and where things are headed and maybe maybe I’ll ask you with all that in mind what

you know what’s your biggest need right now like what what is from between here and thousands of

these being deployed what does high flames biochar need to make that happen yeah you know like a lot

of businesses for scaling up and growing it’s going to take some funding and that’s been the real

challenge right now with between you know looking at a recession that’s possibly coming up

on here in the United States and after getting out of kind of the the COVID issues that we’ve had

it’s been kind of a challenging environment to raise funds to deploy technologies like this

if we’re really hopeful that we can find the right group the right people to work with to where we

could make that happen at a larger scale because that’s really the goal here is to make the biggest

impact that we can for the next generation and we know that this technology it’s essentially going

to be the Model T of biochar technologies and finally enabled the average farmer the average ranch

the average sawmill to actually get involved and start removing carbon from the atmosphere when

that wasn’t always possible and it’s going to take a lot of a lot of teamwork to make that happen

but we’re really excited about meeting new people and opportunities to to find that match that we’re

looking for yeah that’s absolutely wonderful let me remind folks this is the YonEarth community

podcast I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today we’re visiting with Rowdy Gates the founder of

High Plains biochar and you can find out more about the company at hp biochar.com you can also go to

biocharco.op.com of course we’ll have all these links in the show notes you can find

High Plains biochar on Facebook at hp biochar and of course invite you to check out some of the

other related podcast episodes we’ve recorded in the past that tie into this subject and we’ll

indicate in the show notes a few suggestions there for you YonEarth.org want to give a shout

out to some of our sponsors and partners making this podcast series possible and that includes

wheylay waters the regeneratively grown and biodynamically grown hemp infused aroma therapy

soaking salts this is a social enterprise that we incubated through the YonEarth community

our ambassadors have an opportunity when you join the ambassador network to give at certain

monthly levels so that you’re receiving monthly shipments of these soaking salts that are

amazing in terms of aches and pains helping with sleep and so on also we’ve got our soil works

bio dynamic soil activation product you can go to YonEarth.org slash soil works for that

wheylay waters.com and on the YonEarth site for the wheylay waters you’ll find info there

and then finally purium our friends making these amazing organic super food powders and pills

that come right from the farm and all you got to do is add water and you’ve got some liquid sunshine

or liquid readie toss whatever you want to call it we’ve got a special deal at YonEarth.org

slash purium where you can get $50 off your first order or 25% whichever is greater and there’s

a no risk 60 day guaranteed money back deal for you there so if you want to enjoy some of the health

benefits of these organic super foods really encourage you to check out YonEarth.org slash

purium and 20% of those proceeds come back to support our work at the nonprofits so that’s really

hugely appreciated and yeah you know rowdy I am so excited about everything that you’ve shared

with us are ready today and I want to ask what’s what’s a day in the life of rowdy

eights looking like here in larmy you know this is about just under two hours drive from the

boulder lions area where we tend to reside and work and you know what’s what’s life like for

rowdy when he’s not in the workshop or not fired up the bouchard here you know I have a 15-year-old

daughter so I like to get out and I enjoy joy the the lake and the river with her we left

floating some of the rivers around here in paddle boarding this time of year with being in the fall

so hunting season’s going on so we like getting out in the woods and chasing animals around in the

woods a little bit and enjoying some of the wonderful Wyoming outdoors together that’s absolutely

wonderful yeah you know my my son’s name is is hunter as a lot of folks know and when when he was

about I don’t know five or six years old I realized by golly with a name like that I probably

ought to take him hunting and so we we kind of joke that a lot of the time it’s a long walk in the

woods which we enjoy but with some extra weight and gear you carry the heavy backpack and a long

walk in the woods that makes sense yeah it’s an absolutely beautiful way to experience a lot of

the wilderness out west and I imagine some of our listeners may not be familiar that especially in

the Rocky Mountain west a lot of the the fees from the hunting and the fishing licenses actually

go to support a bunch of wilderness conservation ecological conservation and even restoration

projects and this is a huge piece in in Colorado I’m not as familiar with what’s happening in

Wyoming but is it a similar very similar situation here we were I just had a Rocky Mountain

elk foundation dinner a couple weeks ago for conservation projects that they do here the

Muley Phenatic Foundation is also really active as far as their conservation projects around wildlife

oh that’s great ready well yeah I am I’m so excited about what what you’ve been able to accomplish

thus far and so excited to see what’s coming next knowing that you’ve really set the table and

things are poised for all of this to scale up in such a powerful way and I guess you know before

we sign off with our episode rowdy is there anything else you’d like to share with our audience

or you know just say in general about the work that you’re doing uh you know it’s not so much

about the work that I’m doing by buying is like I was to encourage you to no matter where you’re

out where you’re located what your situation is do what you can to make a difference whether that’s

doing some some work with biodynamic soil activators whatever whatever you can do figure out what

you can do and make a difference that that’s really the main thing is that everybody’s situation

is different and just go out and make a difference whatever where you can yeah it’s really wonderful

I couldn’t agree more with that one rowdy and and listen on the on the website for

High Plains Biochar there are also some great videos where rowdy’s walking and talking through

some of the more technical aspects of the technology so I encourage you to check that out and

you know I’ll be remiss if we’re not able to open this up before we sign off on the episode

just to show some of the some of the more uh nuanced and technical stuff we got going inside

the house state university did a great job the folks over at Powerhouse helped us design and build

this control box but they uh they did a fantastic job uh we really enjoyed working with the folks

over there at CSU Powerhouse and you’ve been able to basically through some of this sophistication

with elegant design make it so the unit is extremely easy for anyone to operate isn’t that right

that’s exactly right we’re trying to make it as easy as possible we even have an app so that you

can actually just uh monitor this on your phone and actually shut the shut the unit off on your

phone so we’re trying to make it really uh it’s simple to use uh for kind of the modern uh the

modern world I guess uh it’s absolutely simple technology for the modern world

simple technology yeah I love it rowdy well thanks so much my friend it’s very absolutely
