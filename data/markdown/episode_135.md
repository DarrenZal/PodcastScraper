Welcome to the YonEarth community podcast. I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today

we’re visiting with three very special guests bringing an important episode to you. We’ve

got first Ari Brasil sitting here with the beautiful blanket over her, the founder of Earth Medicine

Alliance. We’ve got also to my immediate left to a Inuvate who is a chief and wisdom keeper coming

to us from a tribe in Brasil. We’re going to be talking a lot about Brasil today and what’s going

on in that region of the world and how we can engage and help out. And of course across the way

here my counterpart Miguel Gil who has been on the podcast before in a previous episode as the

CEO of organic India USA and has recently shifted and is now leading as CEO a company called

focused on gut health which I’m hoping we’ll be able to do an episode on sometime soon to bring

that information to you guys as well. So we’re going to we’re going to dive in here and just want

to welcome each of you to the podcast and it’s such a joy and opportunity and honor to be able to

hear from you and to be able to share your story and the work that you’re doing with our audience.

So thank you very much. Thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity for us to share about

his mission and about what he’s trying to do there in his tribe and with his community. Thank you.

Beautiful.

Two way is a spiritual leader and a chief of the Huni Kuing people of the Brasilian Amazon.

He is from a long line of tradition of medicine people. He lives in the Huni Kuing Indigenous

territory of Rio Humaita South didn’t send to a village. I say it correctly. In the state of

Acre, Brasil. This is a two day boat ride from the nearest town. Two way is a filmmaker and has

already produced a documentary about the Indigenous peoples who still live voluntarily isolated

in the Western Amazon and we’re going to include some links for you guys in the show notes

so that you can check out some of the videos that two a has made and this is the region bordering

the national boundary of Brasil and Peru to put it into some geographic context.

Ari, Brasil as I mentioned recently launched an organization called Earth Medicine Alliance

which focuses on supporting the medicines of the earth and the people who carry them.

Their mission is to provide a platform of support to Indigenous leaders, teachers and wisdom

keepers of various plant medicine, lineages and traditions. We’re also going to be sharing with you

a very special and important GoFundMe campaign that Ari and two way are leading right now and

I’m going to invite you to help out and support a really important project that’s happening

in two ways, Village. We’ll tell you more about that in a bit. So welcome again. I’m glad I had

an opportunity to introduce you each a little further there and very excited to have this discussion

today. I guess to kick things off, let me ask, you know, why are you guys here in Colorado and

in the middle of winter, if you can see in the shot we’ve got snow out there behind us,

pretty far from home. What brought you up here? Okay, so I’m coming from the Amazon that makes

border with Peru, I’m the portion that makes border with Peru. I live in the middle of the forest,

I speak Hunchakoy which is my native language and we have a completely different

reality. We come here across the world with a very important objective and mission.

It’s important for us, for our people, for our community and it’s also important here for the

family in America. And one of the important things is to come here with a message from the forest

from our community and to share a little bit of our culture and tradition with the world.

And also as a way to articulate and to support and help and partnerships for different projects

that we carry on and within our community and you know, we want that help, we’re inviting that

sort of help. Because we’re working for our empowerment, for our autonomy and we’re

less self-representing, we’re talking about us because we have a public policy that will

put our nationality very behind. And this is, you know, the projects are, the focus is to improve

the quality of life of, you know, our communities and this is an important process of empowering ourselves,

of having our own voice, of our own autonomy so we can speak for ourselves and tell what we need.

We have different projects divided in different categories, short-term, medium-term, and long-term projects.

And currently we’ve been receiving a lot of international support.

And specifically the United States is a place that we want to continue to reaffirm our connection

and count on the support.

Because we’re doing this work for our community, our people, but also for the entire Amazon,

for the Brasilian Amazon.

And to use those, the resources that we have in a sustainable way to guarantee the future of

the next generations.

So we live in the forest, but every once in a while we go around the world traveling to share this

mission.

I consider myself a spokesperson and a messenger and a multiplier of my people.

I also work with videos and documentaries.

One of the documentaries and the studies that I do was about one of these groups of people

that have voluntarily chosen to live isolated.

Believe it or not, it’s one of the last few people in this planet that still live freely.

They don’t wear clothes, they don’t speak Portuguese, and they live completely in the middle of the forest.

And they don’t want to be in contact with anybody else.

They choose to live in that way.

And we are working in a way to monitor and guarantee protection so they can continue to have that

choice available for them.

And we’re also preparing for potentially a moment of contact because that eventually might happen.

Because my people, at some point, also lived in isolation without contact with the world outside of

So these people, they cannot speak for themselves, but we knowing the reality as we’ve been through it

we can speak for them.

Because we are working to be the protagonist of that work around monitoring,

protecting and making sure that their needs and demands are being met.

And we also working also around the management of the territory around our village,

but also around our village.

So it’s one of the missions that we have here, as we came here to Colorado, which is very far away from our home.

Because the world needs to know what’s happening in the Amazon.

The Amazon is considered the heart of the world.

And it’s not just the beautiful things, there is also a lot of challenges and difficulties

within that area.

And we know that there’s a lot of people around the world that want to help and support what we do.

But they don’t know how.

So which is why we are here using this means of communication, media.

So for the people that can follow us and accompany the work that we’re doing,

it’s very important and we welcome that.

And we also want to share that we also host people in our village,

and we have an invitation, like as people want to,

are curious about the work that we do.

They are more than welcome to come visit us in the forest.

There are people that are interested in coming for the healing or coming to study

or coming to learn more about our culture and do some sort of an intercultural exchange.

So we also do this work there in our community in the Amazon for the people who feel the calling

to come visit us.

So as the work of the short term, we are also working to be able to support and build a cultural center

in our village.

As one of the short term projects that we have right now is to build a cultural center

in our community in our village.

Because it’s a traditional school,

it’s also a sacred place in which where we make our ceremonies and our rituals.

Where we share our art and cultural expressions and artistic expressions.

Fortalece, we do meetings and gatherings and talk about fortifying our food sovereignty

and create solutions or find solutions to continue to support

the type of work and with around food sovereignty for our people.

Another project is to improve our transportation

and also create a solar energy system.

So besides the short term projects, those are other projects that we’re also working towards

improving and gathering resources.

And also want to make it clear that this is the type of work that we do as caring for

the forest is part of our culture.

Because the forest is our home is our life and it’s our supermarket.

And thanks to nature that we consider ourselves a very rich people.

What we’re seeking is to improve the quality of our lives and the forest in many different aspects.

We live in the border between Peru and Brasil.

The environmental impact is very strong.

With the protection of oil, drug trafficking,

with the perspective of narco-traffic and mining and the forestation, logging.

And then illegal exploration of wood.

And in this moment of climate change we see that humanity in general is in need of healing.

Healing of our bodies, our minds, our heart and our spirit.

And we from the forest we have a lot to contribute within this this context of healing with the world out there.

And the world outside out there has also a lot to contribute with our world and the forest.

So together we are working for peace and the planet and figure out together what kind of society we want to live in.

That’s beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

How’s Shosh?

It’s like a television of Ahu Ahu.

Our namaste.

That was Hosh.

Absolutely beautiful.

Well, I of course have so many questions.

And before I ask a few, I’m curious if REU or Miguel, you have anything you’d like to say as well in response to what two-way was just sharing.

So first of all, Aaron, thank you so much to one of the community again for giving us the opportunity to talk to it.

Explain what he’s just described so beautifully.

You know, my own personal view on this is that the Amazon belongs to all of us.

You know, it’s I think could commonly consider the fact that if there’s a problem in the Amazon jungle,

consider by many to be the lungs of this planet, right?

We’ve all heard the intended documentaries about climate change and the impacts that the potential catastrophic impacts that could be fall as door.

If we let things go to waste and we don’t take care of this incredibly precious resource.

So I think, you know, as two of us said, it’s so beautifully.

It’s a collective responsibility.

And I think there’s also, as he said, there’s so much to be learned in the exchange of information, collaboration between us here in the Western and them in their territory.

And just the only benefit I can come from, from these exchanges.

So I’m personally very passionate and excited about the potential for collaboration.

Yeah, wonderful, wonderful.

I think my, the main thing for me is I see them, the Huniquin and other people as well that are, that their home is the Amazon as sewers of the land.

So by helping them as they have this complete integrated harmonious relationship with the land.

So by helping them, we are helping the preservation and learning how to be and within that harmonious relationship with the land.

And I think that’s something important for us to learn out here.

As we tend to go a little bit overboard with, with the amount of, of needs that we have and, and, and, uh, consummism.

And, um, I feel like what I learn with them the most is that, um, that, that relationship that, um, we don’t, we don’t take too much, we just take enough.

Um, and, and, and that way the earth itself can have enough time to regenerate and, um, and instead of being from a place of arrogance, simply from a place of abundance.

Um, so that’s my, so for me it’s a great honor to, to be here sharing this and, and being able to, to, to be a support, uh, to Tua and, and his mission here in the, in the United States.

Yeah, absolutely beautiful.

So, so many threads to pull on.

So I have to ask, I, I’ve had a, a, a strong connection with plants since I was a little kid.

And I wonder, as you’re traveling, do you miss the four, your forest?

I imagine you have had extraordinary experiences in the forest, and I wonder if there’s anything you might share with us from that.

I imagine that you have experiences, very interesting in the forest, in the forest, with the forest, if you have some, some story to tell to us.

Um, in relationships.

The forest for us is our home, it’s our university, it’s our supermarket, it’s our life, because it is through the forest that we survive.

Hunting, of a fishing, the fruit of the forest, the fruits from the forest.

We have a very strong connection since, uh, our ancestors with the forest.

So everything in the forest for us has, uh, has a forest, has a story, and, and it represents something to us.

Mm hmm.

How do you experience that force, that story or the lack of the force and story when you’re out traveling around a place like Colorado?

Does it, does it feel like a substantially different environment to you?

It’s a cultural shock.

Because where I live, uh, in the Amazon, in the northern part of Brasil?

The climate is very hot, it’s hot.

And there’s a lot of mosquitoes too in the forest.

First of all, we arrive here physically, our bodies.

And then later comes our spirits.

Because we come too fast on an airplane.

And to come out here for us, it’s like another universe, it’s another world.

The mountains, it’s snow, the cold.

We see animals here that we usually don’t see in the forest, like the deer, and there’s just things differently here.

It’s a great challenge and, and, and, and difficulty, but it’s a very important work for our mission for, to, to share, uh, what we have to share here.

Yeah, I see you as a, you’re crossing bridges.

And, you know, a lot of the work we do at the Y&R community is also crossing bridges between economy and business and land stewardship and farming and different healing practices.

And the work he does at the Y&R community, which is the name of the park and the city, is, uh, it’s, uh, about the way and crossing bridges to create connections between business, it’s a practice of different healing, uh, between several aspects of the government, uh, connecting these different aspects.

This is the work he does.

Down from my perspective, we need to heal in all those arenas.

Because ultimately, for example, if we’re seeing destruction in the rainforest,

this is driven by economic factors from all around the world most likely.

Exploration is done.

And often to your point, Aria, earlier about the consumerism.

So many of us in a culture here in the United States are seeking to fill a whole

or experiencing psychologically or maybe someone to say spiritually.

Whatever, by and things, whatever it is. But ultimately, my sense in my heart is

that if we can each more deeply connect with the land, with the plants, with the animals,

with the living beings that we share our environments with, that hole isn’t as big anymore.

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

I wanted to say that to connect with the point of consumerism that I commented on,

that in our society it seems like there is a hole in the deep that we are always trying to fill.

And in their opinion, if we can connect a little more with the land, with other beings that live in this planet,

connect more deeply with us, then there is no need to have to fill this hole

inside of us, that we try to achieve this consumerism, to buy things, to explore.

It is such an important point because I think here in the West, we all embrace the concept of that is good for our health

to have a closer relationship with nature.

And we were advised to take in a stroll whenever you get the chance and being in nature as much as possible

for its natural healing properties.

And those, you know, we are very fortunate to live up here and be surrounded by the beautiful nature of Colorado.

But most people living in this country don’t have the same immediate access.

Right.

And even the ones who do like ourselves living in this environment, we still have so much to learn

about really tapping back into what should be our instinctive, in eight knowledge that we have about having access.

Whereas, you know, to earn these people, it’s an everyday experience for them.

And so natural.

So in eight and this, you know, is I think such a key point in terms of the wisdom exchange.

We’re seeking, actively speaking this for our own peace of mind, for our own wellbeing.

And they have it at their fingertips every day and it’s, yeah.

If you look into the scientific studies on like depression, the incident of depression of that is way less common.

And the forest that is almost nonexistent.

And I do believe personally, it’s because of this connection with the earth, this direct connection with the cycles of nature, the water,

the earth and being touched with your food, knowing where it’s coming from.

It’s such a direct relationship with the planet.

And I feel like that’s essential for our health.

It’s within us.

And out here, we are very removed from it through all the conveniences that we are used to.

Truly.

Yeah, when I lived in New York City when I was a young man, maybe 18 years old.

And I really, I felt in my body this pain of being disconnected from nature.

And you know, now we’ve got this term nature deficit disorder, you know, that actually people are getting diagnosed with this.

And so yeah, your point, your insight is so spot on.

And it, it seems to me, we’ve probably got a lot of interconnected, complex problems that we’re facing as a global family.

But it seems to me this reconnection with nature is one of the handful of things that’s probably essential to turn the corner that hopefully we’re able to turn as a species.

We’re talking about the connection, you understand?

The connection of the planet that has studies, that sometimes you don’t have a lot of depression.

In the case of depression in the forest, not as much as you were here, because of this connection that you have with the earth.

And he said that he died in New York, and he felt a pain in his body because it was coming from it, not to be disconnected from nature.

And I think that today we have a lot of connected issues with a deficit of connection with nature.

And like a diagnosis today.

If we can improve this part, maybe we can turn it into a skin to improve the protection and weaponization of the planet.

Well, I have two questions for you that are coming to mind right now.

One is potentially an emotional question.

I’m not sure.

I imagine you’re in connection and in stewardship of people who have not had contact with the global system, whatever we want to call that.

And you have direct memory in your own people’s experience of having that contact.

What changed? What was different after having that contact?

And has that been really hard for you and your people? Has it been a mixed bag? Has it been good in some ways?

Can you maybe describe for us what that experience is like?

Because my sense is that all of us have ancestors who have had that kind of experience at some point in history,

except for the very few who are alive on the planet who haven’t had this contact yet.

And I’m curious if you could share with us a bit of that direct experience.

He’s asking about this contact part with the isolated peoples,

that they know that you may have an even more ancestral memory,

or maybe you know about your parents or people of your ancestors,

what was this contact?

When I was in contact with Reni Coenhoes in the past,

what changed? Do you think it was good? Do you think it was bad?

It’s a bit emotional.

He doesn’t know the right, but he’s curious about that.

Do you have any memories about that or thoughts about that?

Yes, I would say that from the isolated peoples,

but as you said before, in your experience,

I was genuinely living in that way.

You’re very interested in this transition of life style,

after having contact with the global community.

For the history of our fight and resistance,

we are living 523 years of fight and resistance.

And during this time, we are living in 5 different eras.

The first moment we lived in the time of Maloka,

in the time of isolation, when we had no contact with anyone.

The first era is the time of the Maloka,

and it’s the time of isolation,

where we didn’t have contact with no one.

The second moment was the time of the race.

The second era was the time of the run,

running around.

Which was the time of war between one people and another people,

with still within the Amazon.

And then the third was the time of the Cachiveiro Jail.

Which is when the lords would come and grab our people and mark us

and make us slaves.

And then the next era was the time of the rights,

which is when our land began to be demarcated,

like a reserved, it’s like our land marked as our land.

And we began to organize ourselves politically.

Currently we are living in a different time.

Not with everything guaranteed, but a completely different dilemma.

There is no way for us to live the way our ancestors lived.

We are living another moment of transformation.

So there’s like other people have their story with the way of their culture

and the way they live.

So there’s like other people have their story with the way of their culture

and the way they live.

Do you feel hope for these times that we’re in?

Yes, we bathe a lot in our work,

and we have a lot of hope for these times that we’re in.

Do you feel hope for these times that we’re in?

Do you feel hope for these times that we’re in?

Yes, we bathe a lot in our partnership and on our work,

because we have all the tools to make it work,

to the tools for the collaboration, to make it happen.

Even because we’re not inventing anything,

we’re talking about something concrete, based on our reality.

And even though, especially because we’re not making anything up,

we’re talking about our reality,

something that is actually happening,

facts of things that are happening,

and talking about our reality and our mission.

Yeah, okay, good, beautiful.

Well, the other question that is burning for me is,

in addition to supporting,

through the GoFundMe,

what else would you invite us Americans, us Colorams,

others in our network that reaches all around the world?

What else would you tell us or ask of us

or encourage us to do or invite us to do

that might help in this time of transition?

In addition to helping the GoFundMe campaign

to understand what else you would like to ask or suggest,

or encourage the community that is colored,

or the audience of it?

In addition,

we are supporting the project of action,

so we can implement our project of life,

and put it into practice.

Beyond just this project of the GoFundMe

for the Cook Shower, which is the Cultural Center,

we are seeking other help, support, and partnerships

to implement our project of life,

our projects that emphasize the improvement of quality of our lives.

Because the way we govern ourselves is that we have an agreement

between all the people and all the families that live in our land,

and we decide together how we can better make use of our resources

and live together and manage our land.

So we are working in a political way to improve in the political

and also in a social way to improve the quality of life of our community?

Yeah, it’s absolutely wonderful.

So it’s so inspiring also.

Let me take a moment and remind our audience,

this is the YODE Earth Community Podcast,

and today we have with us very special guests visiting all the way

from Brasil, our both two-way Inubake and Ari, Brasil.

And we are right here with Miguel Gil,

who’s been so kind and gracious to host them in their visit

and also us in the recording of this podcast today.

And as you can see in the video, the background we’ve gone

from late afternoon into early evening with the sunset.

And I want to take the opportunity to remind you

and invite you to support two-way’s work through the GoFundMe.

And we’ll have the link in the show notes for you.

We’re also going to provide you links to at least two of the videos

that two-way has produced along with a whole bunch of social media links

for Ari, for two-way and for Earth Medicine Alliance.

I want to give a huge shout out to our supporters

at the YODE Earth Community, everybody who’s making this podcast series

and our other action and educational resources available.

And in particular, one of the things our Ambassador Group

and everybody who’s a part of our monthly giving program.

And that’s W-E-L-E-Waters.com.

And again, YODE, letter Y-O-N-E-A-R-T-H.org to get there.

Now, I want to shift gears just a little bit

and bring in to the conversation one of the great taboos

and conversations, which is politics.

And any of us who’ve been paying attention to the news

have seen a whole lot of rank or and transition

occurring in the democratic institutions,

both here in the United States and in Brasil

in the last year or two.

And most recently, there’s been quite a big transition

in Brasil with the presidential leadership changing,

which has resulted in some really significant changes

in the institutions of governance.

And from what you were sharing with me prior to recording today,

it sounds like some really positive developments are underway now.

And I was hoping you could share with us a bit about that

and tell us what you think that might mean for the future

of your region and your people.

I think this changes are encompassed the empowerment

of our and our autonomy.

For the first time this year in the Lula’s government,

we had a woman as a minister of the people,

the minister of the indigenous people.

We have a woman as the head of the department,

which is a newly created department for the first time in history,

the department of the Native people or the original people.

And we also have for the first time a woman,

an ex deputy of the federal,

being the coordinator, the chief of the National Foundation

of the Indian Brasil.

And we also have for the first time indigenous woman

used to be a federal deputy.

And she became the head of the president of the National Foundation

of the indigenous people.

And in that way, this experiences,

these are reflecting in order and spreading through other states

in Brasil as well.

And in those indigenous people being taken care of,

in the home, in the house, in the education, in the dreamed house,

and other sectors we have associated with that.

We indigenous people are occupying different sectors

of the government that has to do with health education

and within the Senate,

or different sectors of the government,

to occupy those, and now we’re having an opportunity for more demarcation of our land

because for a while all that those processes were stopped doing the previous government

and now all of those are starting again which is very promising.

So, to resolve, we’re very happy, very grateful, and we’re very, very,

with a great expectation to live a great moment of transformation in our country.

So, it’s a great expectation that we have right now and it looks like we’re going to be

living through a great transformation in our country.

So, we’re very happy and very grateful for the changes that are coming.

Yeah, wonderful.

How do we say hello again?

How’s that?

Well, when we conclude our main podcast episode, we’re going to take a few minutes and do our behind-the-scenes segment for our ambassador network.

network, and if you’re not yet an ambassador and you’d like to become one and get access

to some of those additional resources, you can go to one on earth.org to do that. And I

know before we close our conversation here now, we’d like to hear a song and before going

in that direction, I’m just wondering if any of you have anything else you’d like to share

before we go to our closing song. I would like to invite to share one little thing. The

invitation is open for the people that do feel the calling to come experience his reality

and the jungle. We have some dates set up for June and July, and I’d love to share that

with the links and all those things. So people that feel the calling to experience a different

way of living, learn from them, heal with them, the invitation is there.

Yeah, and I can also offer myself as a potential resource for that too, because my wife and I

are going to be part of one of those two trips out in June or July. And yeah, very excited about

the opportunity. Wonderful. Yeah, sounds amazing. I’d like to go. Maybe we’ll see if it’s a

thank you. Well, thank you very much for sharing with us and opening up and telling us a bit about

your world and about how we can be helpful from wherever we’re located. It’s a real privilege and

opportunity. So thank you. So now he wants to share a song to close our conversation.

Yeah, I’m a man. thank you. Thank you.
