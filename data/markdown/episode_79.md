Hi friends, I’m really excited to share this podcast episode with you.

In it, I visit with my good friend, Brian Stratton Dillon, at his geodesic Growdome up in

the mountains in Colorado.

These are domes provided by a company called Growing Spaces, and they are based in part

on the designs that come from Buckminster Fuller.

Some of you may be aware of the term Buckyball, and the geometry of the structure is essentially

So a Dodecahedron is a 12-sided three-dimensional object made up of equal pentagons.

Okay, so that’s one of the platonic solids.

The dome that we’re in is actually called a truncated icosahedron, and it’s related

to one of the Archimedean solids, and these are more complex three-dimensional solids

known about at least since the time of the Greeks.

And so basically they’re like a soccer ball where you have interlocking hexagons and pentagons.

So the dome that you’re going to experience in the episode is essentially structured

out of pentagons and hexagons.

Each one of those, however, is made up of triangles, right?

So hexagon has six of those, a pentagon five of those.

So you’ll see some of this in the video, and I hope you really enjoyed this episode.

So come on, let’s check it out.

Welcome to the YonEarth Community podcast.

Today we’re visiting with my friend, Brian Stratton-Dillan, Hey, Brian.

Hey, Aaron.

How you doing?

Doing great.

We’re right here in your grow dome, and I’m so excited that we get to share what’s

going on in here, and chat a bit about your story and journey as a horticulturist, as

a musician, a drummer, and it’s just a joy to be here with you today.

Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here and really appreciate the opportunity.

So Brian, for our audience who don’t know this, Brian and I go way back to like the middle

school, high school days, and we’ve been pals ever since connected primarily and initially

through music, and have a lot of mutual friends we keep in touch with, and so it’s just a

real joy to have him on the show here today, and I know with our tour of the dome a little

later on, and also we’re going to get a sneak peek into Brian’s music and recording

studio.

You’re going to have a real treat both in terms of the audio podcast and for those of

you who are watching the video, you’re going to see some really amazing stuff on this

episode.

So before we dive in, let me just tell you that Brian studied under a handful of great

drummers and mentors, including Mike Berry, Todd Reed, and the living legend drummer Dave

Weckle.

He has performed over 1200 performances, has taught over 80 drum students and has recorded

with renowned artists such as Andy Nevala from the Glen Miller Orchestra, Stuart Davis,

the wild divine, the John Parker trio, and has toured in many states throughout the United

States, including Hawaii.

And Brian first fell in love with botany in 1999 when he was living on the island of

Hawaii, where he had the unique opportunity to do garden care for Sylvester Stallone’s

beachfront property on that island, and he also attended the college at the Kauai community

college where he learned how to propagate cuttings, working in the greenhouse on the campus

there.

And then he moved back to Colorado in 2000, becoming heavily involved in the music scene,

and that was in a terrible car accident, and after being a victim of a hicular assault

in 2010, he was set on a different path.

And growing food became a huge priority in his life, and he decided he wanted to move

to a climate that was more conducive to growing all year round.

So he set out on a worldwide tour, including Hawaii, New Zealand, Tonga, etc., and basically

he discovered growing spaces, the company that makes these grow domes, which were sitting

in presently, and realized he could basically have these subtropical conditions right here

in the mountains of Colorado, and grow year round.

So he erected this dome in 2014, and has been able to grow in an agricultural zone of

seven, despite the fact that we’re at an elevation here of 8,300 feet above sea level,

which is an agricultural zone three.

So he’s growing culinary food and medicinal herbs and flowers here year round, and is also

working professionally with a great company called Skyscape Gardens, doing all kinds of

installed, edible landscapes and food forests in the Metro Denver area.

And so Brian, I guess it’s not an exaggeration to say that you and I share a couple of our

very favorite core passions and hobbies from music to working with plants and soil.

Absolutely.

And thanks again for inviting us into experiencing your dome today.

Oh, my pleasure.

Thanks for being here.

So let’s talk just a bit about what is it like?

And I think maybe we’ll try to get a photo up in this video of what the dome looks like

in the middle of the winter after a big lizard.

But what’s it like in your day to day living up high in the mountains and having this environment

to come into?

Oh, it’s amazing.

You know, I’m a native of Colorado and I’ve always loved it here so much.

But in terms of the growing season, it is a shorter season.

And so especially at this elevation, you know, I mean, there’s only a couple or three

months where you can really try and grow things and then you have deer and everything

else that gets to your to your plants and food.

So this is a protected space.

It has rodent barrier underneath it.

I’ve only had one mouse in this structure in six years.

And so it’s just very protected and from the elements and provides a really safe

kind of just perfect growing environment, you know, in the winter, I think the most snow

I’ve gotten here was like 44 inches.

And you know, the dome held up really, really well.

It can take huge snow loads and hail and wind with ease.

And so that’s one of the main reasons I started thinking seriously about building one

of these.

Right.

And the geometry is super fascinating and beautiful to look at, right?

And there’s one of the strongest three-dimensional shapes.

And we know how to build as humans and it’s based after Buckminster Fuller’s Buckyball,

right?

Is that kind of what the design’s based around?

As far as I know, that’s, yeah, I don’t know the history super well.

But I do know about Buck, what’s the name?

Buckminster.

Buckminster Fuller.

That’s right.

It’s called Bucky.

Bucky.

So the geometry is built out of triangles and it’s called a, it’s a variant of a truncated

icosahedron.

I did a little research on this.

And so there’s an ancient Greek mathematician, Archimedes, who identified all kinds of

three-dimensional solids that are more complex than the better known platonic solids,

right?

Like the cube, the dead decahedron and so on.

And the Archimedes solids are much more complex, have many more facets and faces.

So this one is essentially made out of a whole bunch of triangles, but they’re arranged

in patterns of hexagons and pentagons.

That’s right.

So it’s got that hex and pentalpha interchange going on.

And it’s an extraordinarily strong structure.

So yeah, it doesn’t surprise me at all that with these snow lobes and wind lobes that you

don’t have any sort of issues with the structure failing.

Yeah, no, it’s remarkable.

And I think on growing spaces’ website, they have a, they do a test where I think they

drop like a sledgehammer from however many feet above and it just kind of bounces off

of the structure.

So the polycarbonate material that makes up these panels is also really hardy.

So there really is no issue in terms of strength with these structures and that’s really the

issue, especially up here in the mountains, you know, with greenhouse gardening.

Like if you have a standard kind of a frame type of thing, I mean that can work and it

does work for a lot of people, but a hail storm can come through and, you know, in 10 minutes

you’re looking at a bunch of repairs and kind of a whole mess, you know.

So the growing spaces kit really just takes all of that worry and concerns out of the

equation.

Yeah, I’ll just mention growingspaces.com and a great company actually based in Colorado.

And they are sponsoring this podcast episode and have told us that if you want, you can

go to growingspaces.com and mention YonEarth and get a 5% discount if you want to get

a dome.

There are several different sizes and or you can also click on the logo link that lives

on the YonEarth podcast page or sponsorship page and that’ll take you into a dedicated

page in the growing spaces digital ecosystem.

So take advantage of that 5% discount.

I know with with COVID and everything going on in the world, their demand has been through

the roof.

And so their production schedules out like three months right now.

So if you’re interested, good idea to get a hold of them sooner and later and get in

the queue.

But yeah, so it’s amazing what they’re doing in terms of having these these domes in

multiple communities throughout the Rocky Mountain West and elsewhere, helping certain

communities grow a lot more food than they’d otherwise be able to.

Absolutely.

Yeah, and there’s all kinds of programs with schools and communities like you’ve said.

And just a lot of opportunity to teach, you know, youngsters about this.

And I mean, I think that’s the thing if people didn’t grow up in the garden much, I think

it can be kind of an intimidating thing to grow food just period, you know, even just

like a little container garden on the deck or something.

But once you just kind of jump in and try something, you know, you get to hang a bit really

quickly, especially if you have some tips from friends and, you know, resources online

these days.

Yeah, it’s great.

And I think as we do the tour, we’ll talk a little about your soil amendments.

I know you’re working with some biochar in here, too, and you’ve actually developed a whole

array of techniques and tools that you’re working with, right?

To maintain the soil health in here and keep the plants healthy.

Yeah, I’m learning as I go, you know, there’s so much to learn with the soil biome and a

healthy biology there, but yeah, you helped me, you turned me on to the biochar.

I actually used that in the tomato beds this year, and I think it’s helped a lot.

I’m also introducing beneficial fungi and bacteria and also using a microbial superpack, this

product called recharge.

And so, yeah, there’s kind of a lot to talk about with all that stuff, and certainly

a lot more for me to learn.

I feel like I’m scratching the surface, honestly.

Yeah, well, I got to give a shout out to our buddy, Rowdy Yates, who’s one of the Y on

Earth ambassadors, who’s company high-plains biochar up in Wyoming is where I think we

got you that biochar, and yeah, it’s a great operation.

So for those of us in the Rocky Mountain region, that’s one of the best suppliers we can

go to for the biochar, which really does amazing things for the soil, right?

Yeah, it just provides, as far as I understand, any enormous amount of surface area because

it’s so porous.

And so, all that surface area is where, you know, beneficial bacteria and other beneficials

can live and, you know, offer the roots of the plants, a supply of that consistently.

Yeah, I’ve heard it described that putting the biochar into soils, kind of like putting

a whole bunch of apartment buildings, providing a lot more habitat.

Yeah, and yeah, it also works like a sponge, so in arid climates, like ours, when you’re

watering plants, it helps keep the retention of moisture in the soil longer, which obviously

is a big deal in certain climates, so that’s super helpful.

Thanks.

Thanks for showing me.

Yeah, absolutely.

Well, I want to ask, Brian, I know that that traumatic brain injury that you had really

has had a profound impact, you know, no pun intended on your life.

And as hard and as traumatic as that experience was, in many ways has opened you up to a

whole array of beautiful discoveries in your spiritual practice with meditation, and

you’re one of the, I consider experts, and I know a handful, around brain health, and

some of it, what’s going on with the neurology and the neuro biochemistry, and I was wondering,

if you might just share a little with us, what was that process like after the accident

of essentially bringing your brain back into optimal health and back into a state of vitality?

Well, thanks for that question.

Yeah, so indeed, the accident was a really impactful situation that left me basically

kind of stripped of my identity or any sense of just assembling reality.

So it really took me down to the core of, you know, what is this?

What is existence?

What is happening?

Who am I?

You know, although like most fundamental questions, you can kind of ask yourself.

And so that led me into a very curious and deep kind of journeying for really for the

last 10 years.

So I came to find a whole bunch of teachers that people much wiser than I, and more experience

on the topic, or topics, and just really got interested in all that.

And so we could get into a little of that, if you’re…

That would be great.

Yeah, I think it’s really helpful for a lot of us.

So one thing I’d like to mention was learning about Vipashana meditation.

And so I’ve written a couple things down about that just because I wanted to share.

So Vipashana, which means to see things as they really are, is an ancient meditation

technique that’s 25 centuries old.

It’s also called the art of living.

And the technique is taught at a 10-day retreat during which participants learn the basics

of the method and practice sufficiently to experience the beneficial results.

There are no charges for the course, not even to cover the cost of food and accommodation,

which is really remarkable, especially because these are happening all over the world.

All the expenses are met by donations from people who have been completed a course and

experience the benefits of Vipashana’s wish to give others the opportunity.

So I think that speaks a lot to the technique itself, you know, in a new age world of all

kinds of spiritual, you know, stuff out there ranging from great to terrible.

It can be really hard to know kind of what to spend your time with or your money on.

And this kind of demystifies that whole element of it.

So I did two 10-day silent retreats.

And so they call it noble silence.

So it is silent the whole time, which is just a really different experience.

You know, we open our mouths a lot and we, and our ears are being bombarded by all kinds

of stuff, you know, all the time.

And so just a simple 10-day period can actually be pretty profound.

And you know, I could get deeper into the technique, but I think for right now anyone

who’s interested in that maybe just visit the website, we’re going to have a link to

that website.

It’s called dama.org, so dhamma.org.

And you can look on there, you know, say you want to go, maybe you’re traveling and you

want to go to Thailand or wherever, you know, they’re holding retreats.

It’s literally all around the world.

It’s pretty amazing.

And yeah, I’ve really benefited, benefited from that technique.

Yeah, tremendously.

So and I think it’s worth noting too, Brian, that the type of injury you had is this DAI,

right, that fewer than 10% of folks who have it actually recover consciousness.

So like not only have you recovered consciousness, but you’ve progressed very far along that

spectrum of experience.

And what is, what is DAI if you can just tell folks a little bit about that?

Yeah, so that’s, that’s diffuse, accidental injury, which basically means when, when there’s

a violent like shaking of the head, in this case, it was a vehicle going 85 miles an hour

and another one going 55 miles an hour and those hit and then that one hit mine going 55.

So it was like a three car explosion really.

And so and the roof caved in all the way to my, I’m two inches from my seat back.

So I literally, I mean, when I, when I finally went to the salvage yard months later after

this because I needed photographs of the vehicle, they didn’t recommend I go, but I, I needed

to go and I wanted to see the car because I have no memory of this, any of this, anyway.

And yeah, I started laughing.

I had to be escorted with a police officer and I started laughing because I just couldn’t,

I just couldn’t believe that I survived.

It was just impossible the way that the crash or the way that the roof caved in like that.

And a funny side note, the, the police officer that I was with, his lip started quivering and

he actually started crying like, because it, so it was just a really interesting moment

in my life, but um, helped me believe that all this happened.

But anyway, so my brain was, um, all this happened.

It’s just that all this, wait, sorry, what did you say?

I just want you to complete that statement.

Oh, I’ve led you to believe that all this happened.

Oh, well, for a reason.

Yeah, I just meant happened period because I didn’t, it was hard to believe, you know, that

this, when people were telling me, when I woke up in a hospital and people were telling

me all this, I was like, what are you talking about?

I’d been out for seven, seven full days with no memory of anything.

So, um, but yes, to what you were getting at, absolutely, um, and so diffuse, the diffused

part just means it’s widespread.

So there, I had contusions on the right frontal lobe and the orbital frontal cortex, I believe,

and the right ponds and some other ones, specific injuries, but then the diffuse axonal injury

refers to widespread shearing of axons.

And so that’s the real, that’s when it’s really bad.

And so, and that’s what made my prognosis or recovery looking kind of so grim.

But I really believe through the course of action that I’ve taken with just thousands

of hours of learning and, um, and drumming, uh, that’s a big one.

And, uh, getting in the garden and then the whole nutrition part, um, and the rhythm

of the garden, you know, the, the watering and the, the seasons and the, uh, the rhythmic

aspect of that, like, and then the meditation, the brain training, that’s what I like to

look at it as brain training because the word meditation is so, so misunderstood, um,

in our culture, I think, uh, and, uh, the way I look at it is just brain training.

Like, in the same way, you would go to the gym and exercise your muscles and keep your,

your body healthy.

Um, there are ways to do that with the brain and the ancient techniques I like a lot because

guess what, we’re not the first to suffer, you know, we’re not the, people have been

having hardship and real challenges for ever.

And so, why not learn from the techniques that have stood the test of time?

I think there’s a lot to be said about that, um, what I also love to mention Dan Siegel

and a couple of other things if I, if I can, maybe that was the right time to do that.

Yeah, so another thing that, uh, has been life changing for me is the work of Dan Siegel

and he started a, a field called interpersonal neurobiology, which is basically a fancy

way of saying the brain, the mind and relationships and he’s the, uh, clinical professor of psychology

at UCA, at UCLA School of Medicine and he’s the director of the Mindsite Institute, which

I’ve done, I’ve completed a course there and I want to do more, um, the Mindsite Institute

is just a fantastic resource and, uh, there’s a lot to gain from getting into that.

Also, um, some really cool things happening like the Mind Up program, Goldie Hahn was

in on that one and that’s more for youngsters like bringing in, um, some awareness and

knowledge of like the brain and the mind to kids in curriculum.

So instead of the standard curriculum that we have, um, they’re, the Mind Up program

is bringing in things to teach people about the tools they have, you know, and, um, if,

you know, ways to manage frustration or anger or, you know, giving children like tools

to, and, and methods, uh, to deal with life, you know, and, uh, when things get hard.

So that’s another thing.

So his books, I’ve read almost all of his books.

I’ll just mention a few here, um, the mindful brain is the first one I’ve read and it really

just hooked me up.

I’ve never been much of a reader, honestly, um, but I was just turning the pages like crazy

because that was so just fascinated by all this stuff.

Another one called MindSight, that’s probably the easiest one.

MindSight, uh, the new science of personal transformation and then there’s, his newest

one is called Aware, the science and practice of presence.

It’s a great one, oh my gosh, really great, um, and there’s one called No Drama Discipline

which is, um, for, you know, folks who have children and, uh, how to approach that.

I don’t have children, but I read that one anyway.

I thought it was really fascinating.

And then another one called The Mindful Therapist, which I read, um, and that is also amazing.

So yeah, it can’t say enough good things about Dan, Dr. Dan Siegel, uh, and what he’s

doing with IP and B, interpersonal neurobiology.

Uh, so great, and we will include, you know, some links and references in the show notes

as well so people can, uh, easily find some of these resources.

Fantastic.

So thank you for sharing all of that.

Absolutely.

Thanks for the opportunity.

Wonderful.

Um, wow, well, and, and, you know, I think there’s something that probably is, uh, going

to be of great benefit to all of us, right?

Like not all of us have had a traumatic brain injury and a car accident course, but all

of us are suffering from different ailments and things assaulting our neurobiobio, uh,

well-being.

And some of this is technology and media related.

Some of this has to do with the widespread toxins and poisons in the environment and the

food supply, et cetera, totally in the water even in many cases.

And so here you are, you’re, you’re doing a lot of music, playing a lot of drums.

And I’m excited.

I think we’ll be able to share a little bit of your drumming at the end of the episode

because you’re not just banging one, two, one, two.

I mean, they’re doing polyrhythms and syncopations and all very beautiful, complex, highly finessed

drumming and it’s exquisite to listen to you.

Clearly, there’s a lot going on in the brain when that’s happening.

You’re connecting with the living biome of the soil.

You’re eating super fresh, nutritious food, just, you know, several paces away from your

kitchen.

Seems to me like you’re onto a handful of life practices that may enhance all of our

qualities of life and may in fact be key to creating a much more sustainable world together.

Well, thank you.

That’s a huge compliment and I just want to emphasize how much inspiration I’ve drawn

from other people like yourself and like a thousand other people that, you know, like

the way I found out about this company was through a video, you know, it was a YouTube

video and I just couldn’t believe it.

I watched it like five times and it was with a woman named Bree.

I since have looked for it.

It was quite a few years ago and I can’t find it but it was somewhere down south in Colorado

and I just couldn’t believe that they were able to actually grow year round in harsh, you

know, environments and everything and so I think that’s the important point I’m trying

to make there is just that we all inspire each other and I think it’s important to like

whenever you can to take that opportunity to show someone what you’re up to and also to

be open to learning.

I think that’s a huge thing is to just, you know, always be open to learn some new hobby

or some, if it, if it excites you, then follow that, you know, there’s not enough time to

So why is it you and curiously a segue into talking a little more about some of these

ancient practices like you’ve mentioned, the poshana meditation and brain training practices

and also you’ve had some really interesting experiences with different food forests that

you have found all around the world.

And we know the archaeology right now is getting so exciting about understanding what native

peoples were doing in both North and South America.

The Amazon rainforest is very much a human engendered food forest that turns out in many millions

of acres and so in fact they were using biochar.

But you’ve, you’ve had some incredible encounters with food forests, some very, very old in different

spots around the world.

Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Well, so I think the, the oldest one that I interacted with was in a dream I had, which

ultimately led me to, to this greenhouse is pretty amazing actually.

I had a dream kind of in that initial recovery period when I had come home from Craig Hospital

and I was, you know, I was home.

I was still doing outpatient therapies, speech therapy, occupational therapy, pool therapy,

physical therapy.

I mean, it was like, it was intense, but so my sleep was a little funny.

But I had a dream one night about a food forest and I had never heard of that.

I didn’t know what that was.

So I was, it was such a beautiful dream and I, so I got up and I, it was like four in

the morning and I, I googled that and came to discover this 2000 year old food system

in Morocco and it’s incredible.

There’s a, I think his name is Jeff, I wrote it down here, Jeff Lawton, yeah, L-A-U-T-O-N.

If you, if you search 2000 year old Moroccan food forests, you’ll see this little short

video that he explains the food system.

But basically it’s, it has different layers and like a canopy working all the way down

into like root vegetables.

But it has an enormous amount of outputs with very minimal inputs and it’s a system.

It takes care of itself and so I, I was super inspired by that and just thought that was

like one of the coolest things that I’d ever heard about in my life.

So that led me to, I also found out about a 200 year old food forest in Vietnam, which

I do want to visit at some point.

And then I did actually go and visit a food forest in, in Hawaii that was 10 years old at

the time.

Now it’s probably, I guess, 16 or 17.

And that was just amazing, you know, eating star apples and all kinds of different fruits

that I’d never heard of.

So that’s another part that has been, just as a side note, like through this whole project

I’ve found, I’ve learned about all these rare fruiting varieties.

Oh, and that’s a perfect opportunity for me to plug one green world.

So there’s a company called One Green World and their website is OneGreenWorld.com and

they’re out of Oregon and they have been collecting rare fruiting varieties from around the world

since the 90s.

And they have a fabulous website, very informative with great pictures and it tells you whether

it’s, whether or not it’s self pollinating and just all this information, which some,

you know, some of the other companies I found don’t have all that.

And you can hear the clouds are going by, so the solar, waterfall and the fan are turning

on and off.

That’s driven by the sun.

And we’ll go, I’ll show you some of the features of the dome here in a little bit.

But One Green World is just a really cool company and you wouldn’t believe how many berries

and fruits that you’ve just never heard of.

I’ve got one growing right here called Golden Silverberry and I haven’t gotten it to

fruit yet, but it makes these jelly bean looking fruits that are like polka dotted and they

must taste amazing.

Who knows?

I hope to find out, but it’s a Mediterranean plant and it’s got a beautiful leaf structure

and each leaf looks like a painting or something.

So really fun to discover just how vast all this gets, you know, it’s not just apples

and oranges and blueberries, you know, and there’s all kind of stuff you can grow.

It makes me think about, you know, we have grown up in a Western cultural milieu and a common

story most of us are familiar with is this getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden experiencing

apparently.

Interesting.

It seems to me that one of the big opportunities we have in these times is almost recreating

the Garden of Eden, almost reconnecting in a way to that creative, generative force of

nature, of some greater powers and perhaps that’s also part of the key we have now to

not only healing our own selves, but also our communities and our relationship with the

world and in my senses, food forests and Interior living spaces like this are going to be more and more important as we go forward. Yeah, I would agree, you know, I think

Going back to the basics is is always going to be a good idea

You know as we progress as a you know

species and everything

I think there’s at the end of the day, you know, we get hungry every single day. Yeah, right? So

So we might as well know how to grow something. Yes, absolutely

Well, let me uh, I just I want to give a little shout out to you to our friend

Dr. Jandell Allen Davis who runs Craig hospital

And is responsible for all kinds of medical care workers who are working with folks who are dealing with these

traumatic brain injuries and neural

Issues and she’s been on the podcast twice now

As an African-American leader she actually came on a few weeks back to

Talk with us about what’s going on

With the protests with the Black Lives Matter movement and with the murder of George Floyd and it had just an exquisitely

Wise way of speaking to all of this and when she grew up in DCs you remember some of the

The race riots back then decades ago

So just want to give her a shout out because I know she and others are

Are you know dedicating their professional lives to helping folks heal from those kinds of of traumas

And I know the rest of us out in community the more we can help

Create community gardens and access points to some of these experiences is also really helpful for the society as a whole

Absolutely, I mean I couldn’t be more grateful

Uh for Craig hospital and what they I mean what they are doing is just

unbelievable

Like the things that they see on a daily basis

You know doctor Barry and

A handful of other people there really just brought me back to life you know and it’s

Really amazing work. So I’m extremely grateful

For really anyone who’s helping with healing like you said like whether it’s the planet or other people

Or themselves, you know

I think that

Healing is a is something that

Should come into the forefront of everyone’s lives

Everyone has something that they need to heal from

And it’s I think it’s a beautiful process

And it takes courage and bravery and hard work and a lot a lot of enduring pain

But I think ultimately

Has been Tino Massara would say

Pain and pleasure are equal confirmations of awareness

Yeah, yeah, absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing that

Um, I know that you’ve got also another resource that
