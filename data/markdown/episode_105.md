Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today,

we’re actually sharing a different sort of episode. This one is an important introduction

to accounting for social enterprises, small businesses, entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and folks

who are otherwise creating and building organizations doing good in our world. We did this as a

workshop at Elk Run Farm with our friends, Nick and Marissa from Drylands Agro Ecology Research,

as well as our friend, Audrey from Allen’s Farm and our friend Shane from Medacarbon Farm,

these three farms form a special cluster north of Boulder near Lyons where all kinds of wonderful

regenerative farming practices are getting established and expanded. And so we began by doing a

workshop for them to help them in their leadership positions better understand the basics of

accounting and therefore have a foundation to do all of their bookkeeping requirements and to

help manage any other folks on their teams who might also be working on the books with them. So

after we recorded the workshop, we realized, hey, this might actually be helpful for a whole lot

of other folks out there. And so hence we decided let’s go ahead and publish this as a podcast episode.

Now we’re talking about accounting and bookkeeping. So I imagine there are some in our audience who

don’t feel so inclined to want to listen to something like that, no problem. But I also

imagine there are plenty of folks out there for whom this session will actually be really helpful.

So I would encourage you all to not only check it out if you think it’ll be helpful for you,

but to share it with others you know who are launching and growing organizations doing good work

in the world. Okay, so if I just want to mention as well that through the wider community, if any of

you would like to dive even more deeply and or to bring any of our expertise on to do some

advising and consulting for you, you can check out our advising and consulting page. That’s at

Y&R.org slash advising dash consulting. You’ll find that right under the resources sections section

at Y&R.org. And so I also want to just quickly show the graphic that we used during the workshop

just to give you an idea. We talked a little about the history and that there was this Italian

Pat Gioli who around the same time that Leonardo da Vinci was creating all this amazing work,

mathematics, art, etc. This guy Pat Gioli actually wrote a book called Summa 1494 that established

the double entry accounting system which essentially the entire planet is now using. And we’ll also

get into the five types of accounts. We’ll talk about devising credits and how those are

affecting the five types of accounts. And we’ll talk about the different financial reports and

statements, especially the three primary, the balance sheet, profit and law statement and cash

flow statement. Those in the nonprofit world are also known as the statement of position to

statement of activity and cash flow statement. And then we covered a number of processes and

procedures that are going to be common to just about any organization. So invoicing, depositing

monies, building, running reports, reviewing reports, getting into the budgeting and planning process

and then running budget versus actual numbers once all of the budgeting work is finished.

And of course doing the routine bank reconciliation work on monthly rhythm is what’s recommended.

So that’s just a quick overview of what we talk about. And I hope that it’s really helpful

to many of you out there. And I want to give just a quick shout out to all of our partners and

sponsors. And by the way, check out our partners and supporters page. We’ve got more and more

So thanks to everybody. And again, if you are inclined to check out this introduction to

accounting for small organizations and growing businesses, I hope you enjoy. And please be

reach out if we can be helpful to you beyond the content of this episode. We’re happy to chat

about it. Thanks so much. Take care, everybody. And hope you enjoy. I wanted to start by introducing

what the heck is this thing called accounting. Where did it come from and why? Right? So,

is that going? Okay. So before I dive in, like any questions, comments,

oh, I should stand over here. I guess. And how’s that over on that thing?

You’re getting it dark. Yeah. It’s, it’s, it’s some setting. I,

Artim and Jordan, so we collaborate with a company called Earth Coast Productions. And

Artim, who owns it, is on the board of the Y and Earth community. Those guys are always telling me,

oh, you got to do this one setting and this other thing. And that’s just, yeah, I remember a lot

of things, but that’s, that’s not sticking as well. So, you know, when we think about accounting,

and bookkeeping, we’re thinking about invoicing, right? That’s exactly what you said earlier, Shane,

or we’re going to talk about invoicing. And like, yeah, we are. But we’re going to talk about it

in the context of the picture, of, of the situation in which invoicing is doing what it’s doing.

So accounting goes clear back 500 plus years, double entry accounting in particular,

which is a unique little system that we humans have invented, right? This double entry

accounting does not exist in nature without humans as far as we can tell. This is one of the many

things we’ve imagined and created, as it’s true of a lot of what happens in economics, right?

So back at the beginning of the Renaissance, when the Italian city states were sort of at the

center of this exploding early global economy, right? Trading across land over to Asia and elsewhere

and preparing to start essentially sailing all around the world. This guy named Father Patioli

wrote a book called Summa 1494, in which he laid out the system of double entry accounting,

which we’ll be talking about. There’s an earlier record dating back another

almost 200 years by a guy named Amatino Manucci, where double entry accounting is used in the

records of a company. But it wasn’t until this Patioli guy wrote Summa that it was sort of

formally presented as a system in a book. And curiously, if you look at the dates of

that friar, they almost perfectly coincide with the dates of the life of Leonardo da Vinci just

to provide a little more context there. And if you want to dig deeper on some of that background,

I’d put the Wikipedia link in here for you to. So why this matters is that there’s one peculiarity

in double entry accounting that is what makes it work so well. But it also is sometimes really

challenging to understand and actually requires a little memory work to really lock it in.

And I remember back in the day, my parents first asked me if I wanted to do bookkeeping for their

company when I was in middle school. And I asked my dad, well, how much would you pay me?

He said something per hour and I figured that’s like two to three times that I could make

mowing lawns per hour. So I’ll do it. So that’s how I began learning. And after a while was doing

accounting and advising work for a number of companies and actually had to memorize this

debits and credit system that is used when we are using double entry accounting.

So I’m not suggesting you need to memorize it. But I just want you to take the time here together

to walk through what’s happening because it’s going to help, I think, make some sense in some

of these procedural flows. So invoicing is a step that kicks off a sequence. And so invoicing

hopefully leads to getting paid. And so there’s another function which is receiving payment.

And you do that in accounting software like QuickBooks. That’s a step. And after receiving payment,

then you deposit funds, right, which corresponds to literally taking checks to the bank or a photo

of a check if you’re remote depositing or what have you. And then eventually you’re going to reconcile

that transaction along with all the other transactions, ideally on a monthly basis. And you’ll see on

the back side of this paper that there are a handful of additional processes and procedures

and in each I’m indicating the frequency of when those ought to be occurring. So for example,

reconciling bank accounts in general would be a monthly process. Good so far. Okay. Board

detiers yet, Nick? No. Okay. That’s what I figured. There should be some national pride or something

in this. Well, I just want to say to just having guests here that may know a lot about this.

Nick and I are like very much beginners. And I clearly trust Aaron that there’s going to be more

for you also learning to do with why do we acknowledge that you may be versed in this more so than we

are. So thanks for being here. And are you guys accountants? I should have asked that.

My parents are. Your parents are. I think they both. Yeah, exactly. You say you’ve done a lot of

math? Yeah. Yeah. So what’s interesting about accounting is that there’s not a lot of advanced math

involved. It’s all basic computation, really. Unless you’re getting deep into some analytical stuff.

And we won’t get to that today. So the math aspect is pretty straightforward.

The framework of what’s happening within the system of accounting is something that isn’t

necessarily intuitive. And so hopefully this will be interesting and help kind of further

flesh out your working knowledge given that you already have a background doing a lot of books

and that sort of thing. Yeah. Good. So okay. Now there are five types of accounts. And this is

really simple. It’s always true. Okay. No more and no less. And so income and expenses are two

of the five. And then you have assets, liabilities and equity. And income and expenses are generally

expressed on a financial report called an income statement, which for nonprofits is also called

a statement of activity, right? So you got your income and expenses. Now these are types,

general types of accounts. We’re not going to dive too deeply into this just yet. But

under the type of account called expenses, you’ll also find something, find something called

cost of goods sold, right? Which is often expressed as cogs.

Boy, those troopers have been active today. So this is what we find on an income statement,

which is also called a profit and loss, which is often abbreviated like this P and L. And then

for nonprofits is called statement of activity. These are all synonymous, basically just depending on

whether the entity is a nonprofit or a for-profit. Is that good so far? Yeah. So then the other three types

are assets, liabilities and equity. And these are all expressed on the balance sheet,

which is also called a statement of position. And we’ll talk about the third common financial

statement, which is called a cash flow statement. Put it right here in a little bit, not quite yet.

This cash flow statement, however, is not introducing any new account types. It is simply

retelling the story of what has occurred in these account types in a format that is oriented

around the changes in cash position, essentially. And I’ll walk through details on that in a little bit.

Okay, so any questions so far?

Makes sense? Kind of straightforward. Yeah. Now for the fun. Now we’re going to talk about

debits and credits, because this is essentially the logic within any accounting system we’re using,

including something like QuickBooks. And what’s interesting about QuickBooks is that the company

into it that has developed the QuickBooks software and app has evolved the GUIs, the graphical

user interfaces, to such a degree and dumbed it down so darn much that often you don’t even realize

what’s happening in the mechanics with these various GUIs you’re using, like an invoice

module or what have you or a building module or a make deposit module. And for the most part,

that’s okay. It used to be earlier in the days of QuickBooks back in the 90s and the early 2000s

that the GUIs weren’t developed quite so simply. And there was more of true accounting kind of

apparent in the day-to-day work there. And I had a company at one point where we were

pushing so hard on the data tables behind the software engine because we were doing local

food and attempting to track source and destination of all this local food in the transactions,

we were actually working with into its developers to kind of push the boundaries a bit on some of

their data architecture so that it could further accommodate that kind of activity which is really

fun to do. But basically this fundamental architecture requires that we know what’s happening

when we use debits and credits across these five account types. So and I know this is on a

little more clearly written on the handout. So when you have a debit and you have a credit,

these are abbreviated DRCR. And trust me, I’m going through this to get to the conversation about

invoices so that it really makes sense of what we’re doing. So when we, the thing about

double entry accounting is that there is never ever any transaction recorded that doesn’t always

affect at least two accounts and that doesn’t always have the exact same total of debits and

credits, right? There is an intrinsic balancing that must occur within the logic of accounting.

My grandfather was an accountant back in the post-war era and what we now do with software with

clicks of buttons took him and a team of people, mostly men, days on a monthly basis to wrap books

up and balance things out account by account literally each account had its own book, right? And

you can have a chart of accounts with what hundreds of different account line items, thousands in

some cases. So what’s happening is when we credit an income account, we are increasing that income

account. When we debit an income account, we are decreasing it. The opposite is true of expenses,

a debit to an expense account is an increase and a credit is a decrease. With assets,

a debit is an increase, a credit is a decrease. With liabilities, it’s the opposite. So a

thanks. A debit decreases and a credit increases and equity and liabilities behave the same way.

And when you’re on a balance sheet, if this is your balance sheet and that, you know,

BS stands for a few things, your assets, your total assets is always going to equal the total of

liabilities plus equity. Okay. So if you’re looking at a really financially healthy organization,

you’re going to see that number that is the total of assets is essentially going to be very close

to that number. That is the total of equity. If you’re going to see a highly leverage or debt loaded

entity, right, you might see your liabilities very similar in number to your assets. In some cases,

you’re in greater. Yeah. Thank you. Great. So income means in flow of money generally. In non-profits,

you can have in-kind income or somebody’s donating time or equipment, right? But even if it’s

something other than money that’s donated for it to be recorded as a financial entry, there needs

to be a monetary value assigned, right? So income is something we’re receiving from an outside

entity. Expenses is something we’re paying out to another party, an outside entity, an employee,

a vendor, a contractor for goods purchased or services provided, right? So one important thing

to remember is that not all money is going out are necessarily expenses, because you might be

buying an asset instead of paying an expense, right? So assets are things like significant pieces

of equipment, property. There’s a such category as intangible assets. This is like intellectual

property. So if, for example, you’re spending thousands on a patent, in many cases, you would

put that on your balance sheet, which is called capitalizing it as opposed to recording that as an

expense, right? So assets are basically different forms of property of significant or substantial value.

Whose useful life, this is another way of thinking about it, that accounts, think about the

useful life is extensive, often many years. And liabilities is essentially going to be anything

that is owed to somebody else, right? So a note or a mortgage on a piece of property, a

loan on a truck, and so on. And then equity is basically the net value of the organization

that takes into account the net income, as well as net income from past periods, which is called

retained earnings, and the net difference between your assets and your liabilities.

We’ll walk through a few examples thinking about things like invoices that would help us understand

what would happen on the balance sheet as we’re creating certain transactions. As far as just

kind of describing the five account types, is that helpful? Okay, great.

Let’s see.

Okay, another, I think, really important thing to recall is that an income statement,

a statement of activity, is always going to be expressed as covering a period of time.

Okay, so this is a period of time. So you might have a statement of activity for a year,

last year, 2020, which would be January 1 through 1231, 2020. You might have one for last month.

Right? You might have one for last week. It’s a little less typical that you’d be doing

something like that, but that could happen. You could even have a single day. Right? That’s in terms

of time granularity, a single day is as sophisticated as QuickBooks gets. Some of the really,

really big companies might be dealing with even smaller time periods than that, but that’s probably

going to be handled more in their inventory management software and some of the other extensions

of the, not in the true accounting software, unless it’s all integrated. So your statement of

activity is dealing with a period of time. So is your statement of cash flow, okay? So these guys,

again, you would see like if we were preparing financials for last year, we would, oops, I’m rewriting.

We might see, here’s a statement of cash flow for 2020. Does that make sense?

With a balance sheet, instead, it’s a snapshot at a moment in time. So it’s always as of a certain

date, okay? So this is a snapshot in time because it’s a matter of position. So activity is

something that occurs over a period of time and position is something that occurs at a moment in time.

So if we’re preparing our 2020 financials, we’re going to include a balance sheet as of December 31st,

2020, the final day of the period that the other financial statements are covering.

And that would be a complete package for financial statements for 2020, for example, preparing for

a board meeting or putting something together for key philanthropists or you might even provide

snapshot information in your annual report. You could include your financials. You don’t have

to do that sort of a choice you have. But you would have your income statement for the year,

your cashless statement for the year and your balance sheet as of December 31st.

So any questions before we get into like specifics like invoices?

Okay. Does that context help or is it just more like mind-boggling?

Okay. Great. Okay. So now let’s pretend we’re, this is where we get to have some fun and do some

make-believe transactions. So let’s just say we did an invoice. We just had a huge design project,

a $100,000 design project. And so we’re invoicing somebody, right? And this invoice needs to have a

date, right? So that it knows where to land in terms of those contexts. It’s going to have a

customer, right? It’s going to have an amount of money. In this case, we’ll say it’s $100,000.

And then it’s going to have something like a due date typically, right? And you might have net

30 days, you might have due on receipt, right? There are different options there.

You might also have a description of goods and services, goods and or services, right?

And what you’re certainly going to have is an account. When you’re recording an invoice in

QuickBooks, you have to tell QuickBooks what account this is booking to. Almost always an

invoice is going to book to an income account because you’re essentially earning income for services

provided or goods sold, right? So in this case, you might have an income account called

design, right? Or some such name? Boom. Now, what about this double entry business? Well,

the second you record this thing, you hit enter, QuickBooks knows now to credit.

Remember, we’re going to say DRCR. So now we’re going to credit income 100,000.

And what are we debiting? This is where it’s behind the scenes, right? So it’s like,

what are we debiting? Any guesses? To what account? And that’s exactly right. It absolutely

has to be 100,000, right? These need to add up to the same. They have to be in balance.

So we already credited income. Expenses. No, it’s a good guess because that certainly would

move in the right direction. What other type of account would move up with a debit?

Yeah. Bingo. Which type of asset is this?

Aha. This is accounts receivable. Very good. Okay. So now, right? Now if you’re looking at your

ballot sheet and your customer hasn’t yet paid, you’re going to see in your assets, you’ve got

$100,000 of accounts receivable. That means somebody owes you $100,000. Okay. So the invoice

module in QuickBooks is automatically debiting that asset account. That’s all happening behind

the scenes, right? And you have to put that in there like that under assets. No, it does that

for you. This is invisible. Okay. This is just so you understand what’s happening. Got it.

So you put it in there as I’m invoicing somebody, but I haven’t got my money yet.

Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is an interesting little semantics,

splitting of hair’s opportunity, right? Because within the par lots of QuickBooks especially,

and most other accounting software, when we’re using the term invoice, it means we’re receiving money.

Our invoice is somebody else’s bill. So we’re also going to use a term bill, except that means

we pay somebody else. We owe somebody else. It’s almost the flip of this invoice pathway. Does that

make sense? So when we invoice our customer $100,000, they now have a bill of $100,000.

So let’s say we receive payment, right? This is step two in this flow. We’re receiving $100,000

from these guys. What do we do? Okay, that’s a really, really great question and comment.

QuickBooks is doing a few other things automatically to hit our equity account.

And I will walk through that right now, I guess we can do that. So in this scenario,

when we just created this invoice, in our imaginary financials, our P&L, our income statement is

going to show income of $100,000. Expenses so far or zero. We haven’t done anything other than

that invoice. And so our net income is KU MathWiz is $100,000 minus zero. Right. So now on the

balance sheet, assets accounts receivable, which is often shown by AR 100,000, right? Liabilities.

Exactly. We have not incurred any debt in this example. Equity. What does this have to be for

the balance sheet to balance? Yeah, so that plus this has to equal $100,000. Right. So this equity is,

that’s correct, because net income is one of the types of equity that gets expressed. So

QuickBooks is going to bring this directly across. That’s like the very basic balance sheet and

income statement or activity statement after just that one invoice. But now we receive payment. So

something’s happening. Right. We just open the envelope and boom. There’s a $100,000 check and

it’s like woohoo and we put it in the bank. Right. So in QuickBooks, there’s a function called

receive payment, which basically is going to reference your open invoices. And what it means you’re

going to do now is where we previously debited that accounts receivable, we’re going to credit

that account 100,000, which essentially is going to drop that balance on that accounts receivable

account to zero, because it’s going to show a debit of 100,000 and a credit of 100,000, which adds

up to zero. Right. And now we’re going to debit. If we were just going straight to the bank,

we would debit our bank account or our cash account. Right.

100,000 because now we’ve got 100,000 in the bank. Does that make sense? There’s one other

intervening step here, however, that is actually when you’re receiving payment, what QuickBooks

is doing is putting it into another asset account called undiposited funds. So there’s actually

three steps here. And we’re no longer in just your abstract theory and talking about the Italians

back in the early renaissance. This is literally what has to happen step by step to record an invoice

in QuickBooks, receive payment for that invoice, and then finally make deposit, which is a third step

in the module in QuickBooks. And that’s where you’re going to basically bring the debit

into the bank account, which is an asset account. Right. The 100,000. And now you’re crediting undiposited funds.

QuickBooks, maybe silly questions. Yep. How are you defining account? Is that just a list of

transactions? Account literally is from our chart of accounts. And our chart of accounts is

made up of these five types of accounts. So an account might be your service income for design

work. That would be an account. That would be an income account called design work. I’m just

making sure that I’m thinking of it like in the right context. So each account will contain

a list of transactions in its ledger. You’re exactly right. So if you’re looking in the design

account, you would see in that list that ledger, all of the transactions that have affected that

account, which probably would be a bunch of invoices, in that case. Right. And then on your assets,

you’re going to also have accounts like bank accounts, and perhaps investment accounts, and also

fixed assets, things like trucks and trailers. And you might have property. Right. These kinds of

those are each going to be expressed as a different account.

Could I ask something? Yeah. Like the kindergarten version of all this would just be on QuickBooks,

set up different accounts. Design, folk farm, farm to table. And then when you do this, you click the

button, and then you click the button to say receive payment, and then you click the button, and does they make the pilot like, is it all that simple?

Well, sort of, it is.

And this is why the setup of the chart of accounts

is so darn critical.

And we’ve been talking about this also

in the context of your budgets versus your QuickBooks,

which is your actual transactions, right?

And we’re going to, that’s one of the last things

on this document actually is the budgeted versus actual reporting.

So yes, so you’re going to literally, when you’re invoicing,

you’re going to say this is to, you know,

Mary Smith for a folk farm.

However, you may also have expenses.

You want to track as part of folk farm.

So it would be typical to see that you might have an income

item, which would be like folk farm tuition, right?

That people pay you.

And then down in your expense section,

you might have a second account, another account,

that would be something like folk farm staff, let’s just say.

Oh, yeah, that’s great.

See what I’m saying?

And as you have naming convention consistency

through all your different account types,

that also makes much easier the opportunity

to track profitability or net resource generation

within sub-enterprises of the whole entity.

So it would be very good to track the total expenses

related to folk farm, the total income related to folk farm

and have a finger on the pulse of how that’s doing

as its own enterprise, right?

And you might, in expenses, you may have multiple folk farm

expenses, you may have folk farm supplies, right?

Whatever else, you don’t want it to get so carried away.

This is part of the art and science

of creating your chart of accounts.

You want it to be as concise as possible while being

as meaningful and informative as possible.

And there’s actually a lot to discuss in Naderina

when setting up the chart of accounts of an entity,

especially, that has different operating enterprises, right?

So at the farm, Metacarbon, you might

have a section for eggs and chicken related stuff,

another section for veg, and so on, right?

And I obviously don’t know what you guys do

to track all that, but hey.

So yeah, this whole, like, just click the button thing

is absolutely how easy it ought to be day to day

once you know your chart of accounts is properly set up

and that whoever is recording these transactions

is properly trained.

So they’re selecting the right account

because when you’re creating an invoice,

you’re selecting an account from this entire list

of possibilities, right?

And I’ll tell you, I’ve spent hundreds of hours

over the last 30 years cleaning up accounting systems,

sometimes going back 10 years for one client

that had to go back 10 years.

And the paper records were not well organized.

So it was quite a process.

So this is, I will say, with accounting and bookkeeping

really as much as you might see it anywhere else,

an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

It really, really is.

And it’s really worth setting up right from the get-go.

Because it’s a system that as you grow in transaction volume,

the complexities, if you have errors in that system,

the complexity of the errors are just growing through the system.

So it’s better not to have this.

Good question.

So let’s say when your referents are far,

and you said you might have a thing for chickens and eggs

and vegetables and whatever, would you choose

to have accounts for your customers too?

So let’s say go farmer or something like that.

But then go farmers buying vegetables

and cost the eggs and stuff like that.

So will I have accounts that have the same transactions

in each of them, even though they’re once categories

based on what’s customer views?

So I absolutely love this question.

Because it gets at the nerdy geeky elegance

of how the data structure is set up in QuickBooks

and how the logic structure for accounting in general

is established.

And mind you, the entire world is using this now.

Came from the Italians.

The whole freaking world is using this.

And the largest corporations, Exxon, Apple,

are using this.

The smallest little nonprofits, some are still

like just an Excel or whatever, but basically everybody’s

using this, right?

So the data architecture is such that no,

you don’t want to create an account that

is customer specific.

The accounts are customer agnostic.

And the way we’re tracking customers

is through an entirely different list or data table, which

is this customer, right?

So each little thing I wrote up here

is effectively a data table or a data element, right?

Like it’s not like as a date would be a data element.

So you’ve got a separate running list of customers.

So any time you’re creating a transaction affecting an account,

that single transaction is also tied to, in this case,

a customer, or in the case of a bill,

if we’re talking about billing and expenses,

that would be a vendor instead of a customer, right?

And you don’t want to see your chart of accounts creating,

even if it’s your biggest customer, like egg sales

to Walmart or whatever.

You just track them separately through the customer list.

Is that hopeful?

The full card thing threw me up a little bit,

but that was just a project.

That’s an internal enterprise.

Yeah, great.

OK, that’s a great clarification.

If you had an event, that could be the full-farm set.

Like it could be a section, right?

It’s like programming.

Yeah, it’s a section.

Correct.

Yeah, like in the for-profit world,

one way to think about it is your different profit centers

or your different enterprises or sub-businesses.

So programming is nonprofits, is it?

It’s certainly much more common to nonprofits.

I mean, unless you’re talking like an educational for-profit,

I guess that would be an exception.

But yeah, for you guys, you would have events

as another not only potential income account,

but you probably would also have some expense accounts

specific to events.

Now, there’s yet another layer of potential complexity

where you can assign types to do your enterprise profitability.

But for what you guys are doing, I don’t want to get into that.

And I don’t think that would be the right way to go about it.

I think having a handful of income accounts

specific to your different enterprises

and then a handful of corresponding expense accounts

specific is the best way to set it up at this stage.

And should be really sufficient for several years.

Different programs.

This program has an income and an expense account.

So then, and then after you have your what we’re calling program

specific expense accounts, then below that,

you’ll also have your administrative is one way to call it,

right, which is also known as SGNA for for-profits.

That would be like sales general administration.

So this is where things like your telecom, right?

Utilities, rents, whatever, things that are being utilized

across all those different programs, basically,

and common to most are all of them.

And like typically your, for example,

if you have staff that are only hired for one program

or enterprise, you’d probably record

their expenses in that category.

Whereas your general management that’s overseeing everything

would probably be down in this administrative section,

right?

So you might also see your management on here.

So then, we went through the three steps needed to earn money.

Do we also want to go through the corresponding steps

where we’re paying a bill, basically, is that helpful?

I think it is because this is in the nuts and bolts

of what needs to happen.

Is it?

So this time around, instead of creating an invoice,

we’re creating what we call a bill.

And this means we’ve received a bill in the mail.

Maybe it used to be, right?

Comcast or Verizon or whatever.

Nowadays, so much of that is happening electronically

and often is happening with automatic payments.

And those things can be automated in QuickBooks as well.

And I will caution two things in QuickBooks.

Be careful what you automate.

You don’t necessarily always want to automate everything

because then you’re losing track of certain things.

The second thing is I would say, generally speaking,

do not connect QuickBooks to your bank accounts electronically.

Because it just opens the door for things like fraud

and situations you just want to avoid.

And how do you make the…

So then you make the deposit on your own

and you don’t let it say,

I’m going to deposit this directly to your bank account.

You don’t need to buy.

You’re recording that you make a deposit in QuickBooks.

OK, but we don’t say that you make the deposit for us.

So yeah, so there are different banks now

have different levels of integration

where they will push data into QuickBooks.

And you can even activate bill pay, for example,

in QuickBooks, which means whoever’s got access

to that function in QuickBooks is literally

able to send money wherever.

And this is where some entities run into fraud

where Aunt Judy sends an invoice or a bill for $35,000,

boom, and that real money goes out the door.

That happens.

So my very conservative perspective

is not to link your actual bank account to QuickBooks.
