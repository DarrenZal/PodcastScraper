Hi friends, welcome to another episode of our Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast

series at the YonEarth Community.

And I am so happy that today we have the opportunity to talk with Katie Garces.

Hi, Katie.

Hi, Aaron.

Katie comes with a very interesting background and story.

And I’m so excited that we have the opportunity to visit with her today and have a discussion

that I’m confident you all are going to find very interesting and hopefully inspiring.

So Katie is both a nurse practitioner and a certified nutritional therapy practice nurse,

which means that she has deep expertise in training and what we might call the conventional

Western medical world as well as a very deep set of expertise and knowledge in the food

and nutrition realm and which brings together an incredible framework for understanding

how health and well-being can be cultivated in our lives today.

And this blending in her professional background in traditional healthcare wellness and nutrition

with her passion for the healing power of spiritual wholeness for women and men across

the country has Katie helping folks cultivate health and well-being in communities all

Katie also has been producing a whole lot of content and her blog was listed as the 2017

one of the top 10 health blogs to watch in the Huffington Post.

Her work has also been published in Paleo Magazine, Westward Magazine, and her recipes have

been published in Paleo Magazine’s Holiday and Summer Cookbook series, which is awesome.

And then Katie has also founded the wildly popular Denver-based Beyond Book Club and serves

fellow nutritionists and students with her enterprising nutritionist, coaching, and

mentorships programs.

So Katie resides in Denver with her husband, Twin Boys, and their puppy named Piper, and

Katie so much.

Thank you so much for being on the show with us today.

Well, Aaron, I’m so happy to be here.

Thank you.

I know that was a mouthful getting through that.

Well, it’s a lot of important information and I think it’s particularly pertinent to

what we’re going to be discussing today.

I think it’s really important that our audience understands your background, the technical

expertise, the different disciplines you’re coming from, as we’re going to be talking

about health and well-being in the context of our very busy, modern lives and world.

And I thought it would be a fun place to start, Katie, to ask you to sort of walk us

through what you call your trifecta of sexy, spiritual, and sane.

Absolutely.

So I developed sexy spiritual, saying, how about three years ago now, based out of a need

that I found for myself that was not out there?

I was looking for communities and tribes and spaces online and virtually that included

and compassed all of the above, which is just to describe.

And what I was finding was there, yeah, there were groups that were super spiritual.

And yeah, there were mom groups out there, but there was nothing that was doing it all.

The mom group, if you said it works spiritual, you might be kicked out, and then the spiritual

groups, if you complain about your kids or stuff you wanted to kill your husband or something,

you weren’t spiritual enough.

And I just wasn’t like, where all of this is human humanity, all of this is us and we

need a place to be all of those things, a safe place.

So I created sexy spiritual, saying, which began as just a private community for women,

a Facebook community.

And the way I describe sexy spiritual, saying, is sexy is the way we feel in our bodies,

the way we feel in our skin, and it’s health.

It’s how we eat, move, sleep, we do stress, all of the things that make us feel good in

our skin, no matter what the scale says, no matter what size, pants, or wearing, or whatever.

It’s just really how we feel in our skin, and that’s going to be different for everybody.

So sexy is really kind of encompassing that physical piece.

Spiritual is encompassing, finding what that means for us, because what we maybe were

raised with, what we’re into now, or lack of what we’re into now, it’s a really big

component of our overall mind body wellness.

I like to say it’s plugging back into that spiritual power outlet, if you will.

And for some of us, it’s discovering something totally new, for some of us, it’s rediscovering

something we may have left, and it may look a lot different.

For some, it’s finding a whole new definition of what spirituality is, but we are physical

beings having a spiritual, sorry, we are spiritual beings having a physical existence.

So we need to embrace spirituality, whatever that means to us.

And I think a lot of people are scared of the word spirituality.

They immediately get taken back to some, you know, stuffy old church that they couldn’t

wait to get out of.

And so I really encourage and try to help facilitate people finding what that means for them, and

really plugging back into that, because I think when we have that foundation, all the

other things that we need to work on, or maybe that we think is wrong in our life, all

that starts to fall into place a little bit easier and a little bit more slow.

And then the same piece is, especially for us women, especially for the moms out there,

you know, we have eight balls in the air at all times, we are super multitaskers, but

that doesn’t always serve us, and that doesn’t always serve our hearts and our souls when

we feel pulled in 18 different directions.

So it’s really about having that life balance, and we’re told we can have it all.

We think we can have it all, and to some extent we can, but if we’re not doing any of it

well, then we don’t have anything, right?

And so it’s really learning how to say no when we need to say no, setting boundaries,

finding the things that are going to work well for our life, not our neighbors, not the

mom down the street, finding the work that lights us up, not because it’s what we necessarily

want to school for, what our parents think we should do.

It’s really kind of getting back into what’s truly going to make us sane, and then that

life balance.

And so for me, that trifecta is, you know, the physical aspect, the spiritual aspect,

really that mental health, and just kind of getting through the day piece.

And I think when we can work on that, we have the best shot of being truly happy and

healthy, both mentally, physically, spiritually, all the above.

Well, it’s beautiful, Katie, I think it’s such a compelling framework.

Because it excites me as I know you know.

I believe for us right now in our culture, which has, in many respects, become highly secular

in certain communities anyhow, I think it’s so important for us to be able to have discussions

that include spirituality.

And there’s a difference between, you know, me trying to convince you or persuade you

to believe something a certain way.

That’s very different than me saying, hey, part of this experience is spiritual.

And perhaps I might even share a few ways I experience that.

I’m really interested how do you experience that?

And I think if we can cultivate more acceptance around having those discussions, it’s actually

going to help us as a culture create more sanity, more stability, more sense that there

is greater purpose and connection beyond, you know, what we’re going to find at the

grocery store or something like that.

And I’m just I’m curious, Katie, what is something you might share just in terms of that,

that spiritual connectivity that you might experience, you know, in the day to day or

week to week?

It’s not a great question and I get that a lot is, you know, how do I keep in my spiritual

connection?

I think a lot of people, and I used to feel this way too, literally equated spirituality

with going to church or religion.

And I was raised Catholic as you were.

And that’s still a big part of who I am.

And I would say it is a big piece of my spirituality, but it doesn’t define for encompass my entire

spirituality.

And once I was able to reconcile that with myself, it opened up this whole world of things

that light my spirit up and to me that is kind of the definition of spirituality.

So things that I do a lot of things to help maintain and deepen my spiritual practice.

I meditate.

I try to spend as much time in nature as I can.

I live in the city so that might include just, you know, walking my dog at night at

dusk, which I think is a beautiful time of day.

And I try to do it as much of my time walking him per in quiet in peace, just almost like

that walking meditation that I know you and I’ve talked about before.

I read books, I listen to podcasts, I follow people that I find inspirational or that their

words really touch my spirit on, you know, the social medias.

I’m going to go to my first spiritual retreat.

I, you know, I have conversations with people like yourself who watch, understand, and

deepen and explore spirituality.

I always say sleep is a spiritual practice.

I think when we give ourselves to the self-care, especially at older, I think we need more

practice.

But you really respect our bodies need for sleep and rest, that we are physically more

capable and just ready to, you know, hit the day when we’re well-rested and that allows

us to have space for these things that can help deepen our conversations.

I think that’s most of it.

It’s kind of like piecemeal.

It’s kind of all of it.

Music is a huge one for me and I’m not even saying like spiritual music or say anything

that lights me up.

Like I always tell people, spiritual music is the number one thing to kind of raise your

vibe or pop your mood, like if you’re a bad mood, put on one of your favorite songs,

play less.

Like it’s almost impossible not to like get happy when you listen to your favorite music.

Absolutely.

I love that.

I was just meditating on music and how it literally almost instantly transports us in

time and space and psychospiritual experience almost instantly.

And it’s so powerful and we happen to live in a time where our technology essentially

allows us to access virtually any music at any time.

And my goodness, what an incredible gift that is right now.

It really is.

Like I heard a song on some HBO show the other day, it was an old Led Zeppelin song.

I was like, oh my god.

And I’ve been listening to it for like two weeks straight because it’s just, it’s thank

I mean, the beginning of music is just amazing and it just, I don’t know, just like makes

my day.

I pack my kids’ lunches to it every morning.

It’s amazing.

Love that.

Love that, Katie.

Well, I’m really struck by you mentioning being lit up and this notion of light is actually

something we find throughout time being discussed by humans who are asking those deeper questions

about our spiritual lives and so forth.

And of course, in the beginning of the Judeo-Christian story and Genesis, we have the divine saying

let there be light, right?

So this light thing is pretty important and I think that might tie a little bit to where

we’re heading in our discussion.

And I wanted to also highlight that you mentioned walking at dusk and there’s a very special

thing I think that occurs around dusk.

It’s a time of day when some of our indigenous wisdom and elders would tell us that the

gateways to the spiritual experience are more open and there’s something very special,

very magical, very powerful about that time of day in particular.

And before we go there, though, I want to ask about the sane piece in your trifecta.

I am so delighted to see that mental health and well-being is one of the three pillars

that you’re working with.

And it strikes me in the course of researching and writing why on earth, which of course

the subtitle is, get smarter, feel better, heal the planet.

There is so much we can do that is not only bolstering the health and well-being we’re experiencing

in terms of our physical bodies, but also very much in terms of our mental, psychological,

wellness and states of being.

And it seems to me that that is such an important key to cultivating the kinds of lives we

hope for, cultivating the kinds of futures we hope for our kids to experience.

And I’d love to hear you speak a little more about some of the mental health insights

and pointers, even tips that you might share with some of the people that you’re working

I’m glad you pointed that out.

I think that, traditionally, when we think about mental health, sort of from a black and

white standpoint, we think, oh, there’s the people that have the diagnosis, severe depression,

the bipolar, like, the diagnosable conditions, and then there’s everybody else.

And the fact is, like, everybody else, we all have our mental health issues day in and

day out, whether you’re a stressed out mom who literally doesn’t think they can take

their kids for one more second, or, you know, I was working with a client today, who,

you know, her kids are getting a little older, and she gave up her prior career to be a

And now she’s like, what do I do?

Can I go back?

And it’s really weighing her down.

It’s causing anxiety.

It’s causing lack of sleep.

Like, this is what I’m talking about when I’m talking about mental health.

We don’t have to be, you know, in a hospital or on a ton of medications to be in, and there’s

a time and place for that.

Don’t get me wrong, but to be struggling with our mental health.

And so I think coming back to, for me, that spirituality piece, whether that’s really

carving out some time for meditation or contemplation on a daily basis to muck through some of the

stuff that’s swirling in our head.

I always say, you know, when we’re so chatty with all the voices in our head, we can’t

hear all the inner wisdom that we all have within us.

And I think that’s what’s so important about meditation or some sort of contemplative

practice is quieting these voices that go on all day long, that physically and mentally

exhaust us, quieting them enough to be able to hear this inner wisdom, this inner guide,

what the universe has for us, what God has for us, we need to slow down and quiet enough

to hear that.

And then that can help a lot with just kind of getting through the muck.

I think, you know, having a community, having people that you can reach out to, one of

the biggest things I’ve seen in my community of women that has helped them is knowing that

other women are going through the same types of things, that knowing that other women are

a thing of their rope or screaming at their kids and they’re not the only bad mom out

there.

That is hugely comforting, I think, just as human kind to know that we’re not alone

in how we feel even when we might feel crazy or we might feel like nobody else could possibly

feel this way or have this much anger, I think just knowing that you’re not alone in

that is huge.

So does those are things that first come to mind?

I really appreciate that and I really appreciate at the outset how you were talking about

our humanity, you know, really encompasses all of these different dimensions and aspects

of being.

And that in your work, there’s really sort of an acceptance and OK-ness with the variability,

with the ups and downs of our emotional beings and some, you know, some pema children and

others have equated that to the weather.

It’s like, oh, there are some dark clouds rolling through, but guess what?

In a few hours or a few days, it’s going to be sunny again.

And often that, you know, is perhaps one of the most apt ways to describe what goes on

with us as emotional beings and to just recognize that and to say, that’s OK, that’s who we are.

I think is a huge and an important step in moving in the direction of greater balance,

health, well-being and so forth.

Right.

I also think that as a society, we are so used to having a quick fix, there’s a quick

fix button for everything and maybe this will lead us into our next component, but whether

it’s, you know, hopping on the TV and numbing out with the TV show or hopping on our phone,

getting our Facebook fix, if we’re feeling crappy about something, we have some unpleasant

emotions that we don’t want to feel, we have tons of ways out right now as a society.

And we have lost the ability, and I might say it’s our innate ability to just sit with

it and be with those unpleasant feelings because we don’t have to as a society.

But in order for us to move through them, in order for us to move out of these dark

places, we have to sit with them, even though they’re uncomfortable and even though it’s

not fun.

But when we continue to escape with our various ways of escaping, we’re not really doing

ourselves any long-term benefit, we might feel better for the moment, but we’re not

making a situation better.

We’re certainly not going any further out of whatever that is that we’re struggling with.

Absolutely.

Well, I think it is a great segue.

And so here we go, drum roll.

We’re going to be talking about some things here, Katie, that you and I have been personally

sharing with each other, but haven’t been talking so much publicly about, and I know we’ve

also had the opportunity to chat with some of our friends and peers, and it’s interesting,

because when we’re talking about health, well-being, when we’re talking about the sexy, when

we’re talking about the spiritual, and when we’re talking about the mental sanity, there’s

this nexus point that connects all these thoughts in a sense, which is our neuroviochemistry,

right?

There’s so much going on in our complex biochemical bodies that is related to mood, that is related

to what’s happening physically and so on.

And one of the ways we quickly fix when we’re feeling stressed, or we’re feeling unpleasant

about something, is what, we pour a glass of wine or a martini or a gravacold beer,

and you and I were now at an age where we’re really beginning to say, you know what,

that might not be one of the most effective tools any longer for working as a human being

through all of the different ups and downs and the mucks and so on, and so you and I are

both experimenting with not drinking alcohol.

And I think it’s an amazing opportunity to share with our friends and our audiences

and other folks out there because it seems to me the more I talk one-on-one with an

old high school buddy or a colleague about this, that person will quickly say something

like, wow, I’ve been thinking about that too, and let’s talk about that a little more.

And so Katie, here we are, having a very public discussion about this, and I’d love to hear

from you kind of where you’re at in this journey with your relationship with alcohol, with

the spirit.

Right, and ironic that that’s what it’s called, right?

I know you’ve shared a little bit about that too with me before, but yeah, so I start

drinking in July, and this was a very long time in coming decision, one that I have wrestled

with in my mind for quite a while actually, wine and alcohol, and that activity is going

to part of my life for most of my life.

It was in my family growing up, not in a problematic way, it’s just always been there.

And I think, as you mentioned, as we get older, for me, it was two-fold, there’s the physical

component of, as we get older, we just don’t tolerate it as well, I could have one glass

wine and feel it not sleep that night, so crappy the next day, I really have it ruined

my day, maybe not make it to the gym, then you feel bad on yourself, and you’re maybe

not feeling great, so you eat kind of crappy, and it’s just like this, you know, kind of

negative spiral.

But then there’s that whole other piece that we’re talking about, sort of the emotional

spiritual, mental piece, and I feel like in a way it was kind of like swashing my

spirit.

Here I am, constantly trying to grow, evolve, learn more about myself, come into my own,

do the same, help other women do the same, and I kind of felt like my relationship with

alcohol was beginning to hinder that, I also was recognizing that it was becoming more

of a habit than I wanted it to be, and with any habit, they’re hard to break, and especially

a habit that you’re consuming, what’s proven to be an addictive substance, it’s going

to be that hard, much harder to break, it’s one thing to, you know, you know, change

it, easy habit, it doesn’t include a substance, but, you know, it’s easy, but easier.

So I just was recognizing all of this, and you know, it wasn’t that I was identifying

with being an alcoholic, I wasn’t, I didn’t have some major life event, or a hit rock

bottom.

I’d even heard the term gray area drinking, which I would say I feel a little bit more

with, just kind of zooming out a little bit and taking, you know, inventory of my life,

the areas, you know, I talk a lot about self-care, and I obviously talk a lot about health

and food, and the things that we can eat, and the way that we can live to eat as healthy as

we can, physically and emotionally, yet here I am putting, you know, a toxin, essentially,

right, into my body on a regular basis, it started to feel incongruent, and it started to,

you know, they say alcohol works till it doesn’t, a lot of things that we do work for us until

they don’t.

And I just didn’t feel like it was working anymore.

I was still in counterproductive, to my productivity, to my happiness, to my presence, in my life,

with my clients, my friends, my kids, and my husband.

So it was just a choice that I felt was long-term in coming, and one day I just decided.

So beautiful.

Well, I really appreciate in our friendship that we’ve been able to share back and forth

over the months and even over the years, and one of the things that, to me, is so awesome

about not drinking for several months now, is probably now a few times a week.

I suddenly get this aha, and it’s like, oh my gosh, it’s sort of like, I have twice

as much time as I used to have, and in part, this is because for me, when I would go

in in an afternoon or an evening and enjoy some wine or beer with friends, often the next

day, I feel so sluggish and physically drained, but also I feel like mentally rather foggy

and not firing on all cylinders or whatever the expression is.

And now it’s like, wow, every day I’m clear and productive and able to say, whoa, I’m feeling

tired, perhaps it’s time to go take a walk in the woods for a few minutes or whatever,

to have a little bit more of that self-awareness that I think helps us kind of navigate through

all the different weather, the daily weather, in a way that we’re probably not only taking

better care of ourselves, but perhaps we’re even more fun to be around and better folks

in our families and communities and all of that as well.

So anyway, to me, there’s all this upside in my experiment of not drinking alcohol.

Absolutely, I agree.

And right after I stopped, we had tickets for a concert, and I was really worried because

I don’t think I’ve ever been to a concert sober, but I really went into it just kind of

to see, just as an experiment, like, how was this going to go?

And I was pleasantly surprised that I was still up on my feet, singing and dancing.

I remember every minute of it, it was, I wasn’t hung over the next day, I was just amazing

to me that that possibility even existed, because I wouldn’t have even entertained it before

to be honest.

And I think that, you know, it’s part of, it’s kind of part of growing up, just what are

our priorities and how do we want to feel and how do we want to show up in our life for

not only the people in our lives, but for ourselves, because, you know, we’re all blessed and

lucky enough that we haven’t given this wonderful life.

And we have the choice, what we want to do with it.

And I agree, when we’re feeling sluggish and not on our game, then we’re not able to

show up and bring all the awesome things that we have to share with the world.

So I love that you’ve been doing it, you’ve been a huge inspiration for me.

And it’s exciting.

I actually feel like the biggest feeling or emotion that I’ve had about this is freedom,

because I don’t feel obligated, I don’t feel, oh, shit, I shouldn’t, I’m not doing

tonight.

It’s off the table.

And that’s okay.

I have freedom to not worry about needing to sleep in, because I’ve been up at a party drinking

There’s just so much freedom that it’s been given to me already.

And it really excites me for what that’s going to allow me to do in the future.

It’s so beautiful, Katie, well, it makes me think about a spiritual freedom that perhaps

shows up.

And you know, I remember talking with my brother, Ethan a few months ago, and he shared

with me, wow, Carl Jung, the philosopher and psychologist actually wrote a bit about our

relationship with alcohol.

And I didn’t realize this till he was explaining it to me.

And what Jung said was essentially, for a lot of us, consuming, inviting alcohol is part

of an impulse to have deeper connection with the divine, to have deeper spiritual experience.

But of course, it gets in the way of that authentically occurring.

And it’s interesting to me that part of this spiritual searching and exploration we humans

have been doing for a long, long, long time, is that it’s very closely linked to the

notion of freedom.

And I’m really wondering if for us and some of our other friends and peers, if there

isn’t perhaps also an opportunity to experience more spiritual connectivity in our lives

when it’s no longer being sort of substituted by the effects of drinking alcohol.

I agree.

I agree 100%, and I would say in the past I was seeking those deeper spiritual experiences

with lying or what have you, but now that I am clear at all times, I feel like even on

my evening walks, I’m so much more clear and so much more, I just feel like I’m so much

more open to see whatever it is that I need to be receiving.

I definitely feel more connected, and that’s what I wanted, and that’s what I was kind of

searching for.

And I feel like it was kind of a shoulder tap from God, the universe, and it was just a matter

of time for me to be ready to accept that, and I appreciate that tap, tap, tap, and

the people in my life like you that kind of come up and showing, and by example, and

I think when we pay attention to those shoulder taps, we eventually know what we need to do,

and I do believe that timing is perfect for everybody, so I’m just very thankful for all

Absolutely, Katie.

Well, I know that the conversations, the sharing, just in our recent discussions, is so

powerful, and for me, back to this dusk and light, and late afternoon, early evening,

gloaming is a term some of our friends may know.

There’s a time of day when that light is really getting magical, and that’s when I tend

to say, oh boy, it would be nice to have a nice, cool glass of sparkling wine or something

like that, but that’s when I think, no, I have friends out there, I’ve had these conversations

with, I know there’s something deeper going on here, I don’t actually need that wine.

I’m not going to have that wine.

And anyway, for me, it ends up being very liberating, so now I can enjoy that moment when previously

it would be a very tempting time of day, and now it’s like, wow, it’s kind of a fun,

almost comical, but still kind of profound part of the day where I can appreciate the beauty

and just have a feeling of gratitude to be able to make these kinds of choices now.

Right, and presence, just being fully present.

Absolutely.

I think that part of the reason that, you know, that time of day sort of speaks to us is

A, it’s habitual, right?

Maybe we’ve been doing it for lots of years, it’s, you know, happy hour or, you know,

it’s just kind of what we do at the end of the day, but also I think it’s so societal.

And I think they say like 80, 80 to 90 percent of adults in the US drink.

And again, I’m not judging anybody and everybody, you know, do your thing, but I think we’re

so, it’s so normalized and it’s so, you know, this is what we do, and this is how we

unwind, and this is how we relax.

And it’s made to look very attractive on, you know, she’d be in magazines.

And even when you walk by and you see a couple, you’re not having the last line, it does,

because it looks so nice.

I want to be a part of that, you know, so I think sort of unlearning that or unwinding

that is part of the process.

I know it is for me, and just kind of getting past that initial like, ooh, that looks nice.

But you know what?

I can have just the same experience.

It’s not a greater one.

It’s my starting mother.

Right.

That’s so beautiful.

Katie, well, I know that you are inviting folks to join you for the stop tober event that

you’re doing in October, the accountability and support group in October for those interested

in trying a month without alcohol.

And in the show notes are some informational links for folks who want to check that out.

I want to make sure that people know about Katie Garces.com that go and check out your blog.

And to also look at the sexy, spiritual, sane Facebook group where you’re working with

a whole bunch of like-minded women who are on that path of cultivating health and well-being

and all those different dimensions.

Katie, is there anything else in terms of resources and events coming up that you want

to share with folks?

I think that’s everything.

You know, on social media, I do post quite a bit, pretty active on Instagram and Facebook,

and that’s also that Katie Garces.

And yeah, regarding the stop tober, that’s again just a group for people who are maybe

curious and exploring their relationship with alcohol, just by no means defines you or

commits you to anything.

It’s just to start with just sort of a challenge just to see, can I do this?

Do I want to do this?

How do I feel when I do it?

So there’ll be some educational pieces.

It’s going to be pretty low key, but just an opportunity for us to walk through this

together and explore and see what may come for it.

So I would really invite people to check that out and join us.

Beautiful.

Thanks, Katie.

I also mentioned for our audience and listeners that this is the Why On Earth Community Stewardship

and Sustainability Podcast, and I want to invite you to go to our whyon earth.org slash

market and use the code podcast to get special discounts on our digital products, including

the audio book version of Why On Earth.

And we’re so excited to share that with you all you’ll find in Why On Earth that a

few of the chapters in particular connect, delight, culture and balance are probably

really nicely tied to the discussion we’re having today with Katie.

And also wanted to mention in Katie you reminded me of this before the call that are recently

launched relaxation soaking salts, whey-lay waters also provides one of the opportunities

for great self-care on a day-to-day week to week basis and want to invite folks to go

to whey-lay waters.com, check out our free soaking ceremony guide if you’d like to check

that out.

And I think in that spirit, Katie, I mean so much of this is really about uping, enhancing

our health and well-being experience, and well, some of that is what we choose to put

A lot of this is also what we choose to pick up in the way of new habits and new practices.

And I know you and I spend a lot of time developing some of those frameworks to share with folks.

And maybe we could end wrap up our discussion, Katie, by you sharing with folks some of your

favorites and what you would suggest in lieu of drinking from time to time.

I think it’s really important that if we’re going to take away a habit or something that

we routinely do, like you said, we fill it up with something.

So that’s a, you know, whether that’s a come home from work, changing up your routine

or end of the night routine.

So something like so-teen and whey-lay waters would be amazing, but there’s so many other

benefits with those back salts.

I recommend women, I mean, all of the things we’ve talked about are awesome and important.

But I think women, especially moms, we tend to be a little bit, I don’t want to use the

word martyr.

But, you know, we feel almost guilty if we take any time for ourselves.

So I like to give women permission to go book yourself a massage or go get your darn toes

done and relax and don’t go guilty to just take some things that make you, that you’re

just loving up on yourself and you’re feeling like a woman and you’re feeling like you don’t

have to be a mom for that moment and you don’t have to worry about your business for that

moment or wherever it is.

That’s just feels like when I do it, I feel like I’m spoiling myself and that feels good.

And for a lot of years, I didn’t think that was okay.

And so I think that’s a huge part of self-care and finding and doing the things that you love.

Don’t do an exercise routine because everybody says it’s what they should be doing.

Do it.

Do find something that you love.

Find that something that makes you feel good and make you feel the way you want to feel.

Those are the things.

That is what self-care is and being okay with your decision.

Absolutely.

So beautiful.

Well, Katie, thank you so much for being with us today, Katie Garces, and it’s been a pleasure

talking with you.

Now, thanks so much for having me, my great.
