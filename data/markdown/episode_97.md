Welcome to the YonEarth community podcast. I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today we’re

visiting with the founder of liquid trainer Ron Lamire. Hey Ron. How are you? Good. How you doing?

Good. Looking forward to this. Yeah, I am too. Really excited. We got a lot to share as folks.

Ron is a graduate of main maritime academy and became a marine engineer. He worked out at C for a

few years following and worked for oil companies on tankers mud boats and seismograph boats covering

all aspects of oil development from searching for oil fields to drilling for oil by delivering mud

to the rigs and transporting oil on tankers. Sometimes he didn’t see land for six months.

After becoming disenchanted with the oil industry, he wanted a change and drove to Boulder,

Colorado. While heading west, as the Rocky Mountains appeared in the distance, John Denver’s famous

song Rocky Mountain High was playing on the radio. After years of deep study and ralphing,

Moshe fell in craze, science of centering, and body-centered psychotherapy, Ron received an

invitation to ask him to provide a healing session to an anonymous client whom he found out was

John Denver. This set his life on a new trajectory, including spending most of the 1980s traveling

with John Denver. Never returning to the seat of work, but deepening in his commitment to body

healing, Ron would incorporate his experience in body-centric knowledge into developing the liquid

trainer, which we are excited to share with you today. Ron, it’s really a joy to have this

opportunity to visit with you, and we’ve of course had a handful of wonderful conversations these

past several months. And what I’m excited about with this particular episode is that we’re going

to be offering a really cool training health and wellness fitness device to folks to get at a

discount, but we’re also going to have an opportunity to kind of peek into the last several decades

of history here in the Boulder, Colorado, Aspen area, and some of the things that have unfolded in

that really magical period of time. So, you know, Ron, I thought I would just kick it right off

by asking you, what was that like coming from the east, driving west, and seeing those mountains

start to grow little by little as you’re listening to John Denver’s music? Oh, centering a new threshold.

And it’s really interesting time because it was in the early 70s. So, I just wanted to see the Rocky

Mountains, like the physical aspects of them, you know. I didn’t think of anything else. And then

when we rolled into Boulder, it was like going through a curtain of time. It was a renaissance.

There was so much aliveness and consciousness that it was baffling. It was totally baffling. It

shattered all the logic that I was carrying around for quite some time. Now, at the time in the

early 70s, there was a, you could say an invasion from the east, and the west was standing on its own

ground. So, we had like Ayurvedic medicine. We had yoga, meditation. We had Chinese medicine,

Japanese, macrobiotics. We had yoga, martial arts, and all the different modalities that were

here in Boulder already, which was where Ida Roth was beginning her guild. Honourable Wolf was

beginning the Masonic school. And it was, from Tibet, Chogium, Trungpa, Rinpoche came through and

opened up Buddhism to all of us here. And then it was Rejnich with all this

ancient orange people running around in their robes, orange robes. And you had Yogi Bajjan,

people wearing white turbans and white and kidney and daggers. That’s a very colorful time.

Now, it’s, I was, because of my engineering background, somehow, I got involved in looking at

structure in the human body. I had a teacher named Dr. Binder, who helped me basically shift my

understanding of my health. He was an active puncture, or he is an active puncture, a homeopath,

a chiropractor, naturopath, and basically I saw him regularly and was guided to learn lots of

different things. And one of the things that he taught me was a thing called Position Technic,

which is a science of century. And it was applying suspension mechanics to the human frame. And

because I thought a lot logically about how a ship was, you know, kept in balance by ballastine

with midline of the tanger or whatever. And the structures of the ship and how it stays together,

it was to me, studying anatomy and physiology in the interest of learning Position Technic was

just downloading. It was just, you know, who created what, right? The human body or the ship

we came first, but everything that we’ve ever seen in systems like that, I began to see in systems

in ourselves, you know, and how the cellular body works. So I really was interested in understanding

structure. And that was my approach to health and vitality. And from there, it started making

senses to how important core was in more movement modalities like yoga martial arts and things

like that over the years. That’s great. Yeah, and we’re going to have an opportunity to chat a bit

about not only some of your experiences on land, but also at sea. And apparently there was a great

story you have to share with Jacques Cousteau. And I want to, before getting to that, I want to ask you

what, what was it like, you know, those, those times when you were working at sea for so many

months like that and not seeing land? Very Newtonian. Yeah, expand. I would, I have the way that I

worked on that particular boat. It was a seismograph boat where we had these cables going out,

dragon, and they would sense the bottom and tell whether it was oiling us. So with our shifts,

we’re 12, 12 hours on, 12 hours off. In my, a lot of my off time, I had a library with me,

and that’s all they did with study. And I would meditate a lot. And I remember one time just

meditating on the open sea, all of a sudden we ran into a sea of flying fish. And they just came

on deck and we had, I had to kind of bail them back out, you know, a lot of bizarre things happened

when you don’t see land for six months. But interesting thing also is you learn about ground

reaction force. And that’s the opposite reaction that you have when you step gravity comes and gives

you an opposite reaction. Now, when you’re on a boat, you have to be very grounded. You can’t walk

above your center. You have to be totally grounded into your center. So if you’re at the

bow and in the boat is listing, you know, starboard and port, whenever the, whenever the starboard

side comes up, you push away from it, shift your weight to the left side, and then you push away,

you have to be stuck to the deck. And you have to go with the rhythm of what the deck, how the deck

moves. And in order to do that without getting seasick or any of that is you have to think from

the ground up. And that’s called ground reaction force. And that understanding, maybe in the six

months of being out to sea, was totally in myself to understand how we work, how we walk on the

earth. Because you never think about ground reaction force on the ground. But I can help you relate

to ground reaction force if you’re on a boat, right? So interesting. And here we are, our feet,

you know, firmly planted on the ground. And part of your technology, of course, the core of it is

that you’re working with, with water, with liquid, as you’re moving it around. And I thought maybe

do you mind holding up the liquid trainer just so we can show folks. And at the end of the episode,

Ron’s going to actually demonstrate how to use this. And I got one a few weeks back. And it’s

been so fun to think that, you know, whether we’re living in an apartment in the middle of a city,

or in the suburbs, somewhere, or out in a rural setting, this trainer should be very easy for us

to utilize in just about any environment or circumstance. And it really, it gets a full body

flow going in a way that a lot of the other exercise equipment doesn’t seem to.

It does. At first, in the first lessons, you learn ground reaction force. And relative to

where the water is in the bag, so what you want to do with the liquid trainer is learn how to send

the water from one end to the next. And then it happens, it almost, it happens in all planes of

movement. What you do to one side, you have to do equally to the other. And because you have this

little extra two pound weight, it tends to want to just pull the tendons enough to say,

I want to go further, I want to go further. And first thing, you know, this simple movement

becomes very fluid. You start to let go, you start your fascial tissue starts to win wine.

And the first thing you know, you’re posture straighter because the erectus benign muscles are

equally used in a circular way. Very incredible bonus. You only have to do this for about a week or

so, and you’re going to be walking differently. Yeah, it’s so great. It’s so exciting. And we’re

really excited to announce also that liquid trainer is now part of our regenerative economic ecosystem,

which means that with the code Y on earth, when you go to liquid trainer.com, you’ll get a 20%

discount on your purchase and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Y on earth

community to support our podcast episodes and our community mobilization work going forward. So,

it’s a real win-win-win run. And we’re really excited about the relationship and sort of bring

it in the new year 2021 with this in mind and inviting folks to make liquid trainer a part of

their health and wellness routine. It should be a lot of fun. And you think about it, we are

sales of the planet. The planet is 70% water, we’re 70% water. The planet turns in a kind of

clockwise direction and we are dominant side is kind of clockwise being right handed. And so,

when you do a movement, whenever you take this, you could look at it because it’s sort of like a

flexible plastic, right? This is a special polyure thing. And it has an incredible strength,

durability you’ll never ever really through movement, ever puncture it. You’ll puncture it through

putting it on the wrong kind of changes. Yeah, if you poke it on a bad ground or

stalactite ceilings and hotels, you know, those are the kind of things. But just on your own,

if you had the free movements to toss this water around, you will not ever, ever break this.

It’s got such great durability. Now, you think about it, it’s just like your skin. So, if you take

care of your skin the same way, if you take care of the bag, the same way you take care of your skin,

it could last you, you know, decades. A lifetime, huh? Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it’s how you take

care of it the same way because it’s like your skin as well. You could say, this is like our new

aquarium technology of adding an appendage to bring you back into balance because whenever you do

a movement from right to left of left to right, in any plane of motion, you’re basically

optimizing ranges of motion that you never knew you had. So, it restores a lot of the early

movements you lost through your education. This brings you right back into a real sense of balance.

You’ll know where your core is, you’ll know how you stand, erect, wise, and you’ll feel more

suspended. So, this is why I stuck with this thing. You know, when we were living here in Boulder,

Chris and I, we had a, Lelea was around 11 or 12, something like that. She was at a shiny mountain,

you know. And I, at time, had enough bags to teach people. And she says, you know,

maybe you could help, you know, a class, you can teach the class. So, I got this Waldorf class.

And they were like between 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. And so, at first, this

two of the young boys, probably around 10 years old, were like, they had this kind of posture,

you know. And you see that a lot, right? It’s like two of the bones are growing faster than

the muscles so they’re like tight, right? And they thought, oh, that’s interesting. We’ll see what

happens here, you know. Because at the time, I was just using the bag to rehab shoulders,

because it did such an incredible thing with shoulders. And so, I really, it didn’t connect yet.

I still had seven years into, you know, cultivating movements and working with the inventor and

different teachers that were around. And when I, we had three classes per week, and then we did

that for three weeks, and then we had Christmas break. So, I talked to them all the

movies, thinking about these kids at that age, is that you can’t just show them one or two

of them with their movement junkies. You have to like feed them at every, keep their attention,

their interest, the whole thing. So, two weeks goes by Christmas. They come back, we have another

class, and all of a sudden, these two young boys that I saw that were like this, all of a sudden,

were like this. And I’m going holy smokes. What happened here? So, I was curious as to what

therapist they went to see. Because I’ve worked on a lot of kids like that, and changing the

structure that dramatically is not done in raw thing, it’s not done in Feldenkrais, it’s not done

in any of these. This is, it’s a real serious structural, almost adhesions because the muscles are

tied in. So, they said, no, we didn’t, we didn’t see any therapist. I said, what do you mean?

Didn’t have anybody work on you? No. I said, what did you do? Well, we got a lot of movies to show

you. We’ve been working at these movements, like hours every day. And we’ve got like three or four

that I’m sure you’ve never seen before. And so, it was the bag. That’s when I, that’s when it’s

totally gone. I’m saying, holy smokes, if they can do this to this, what can it do? To that

generation who learns how to do this. And by the time when they get into sports, they’re going to have

a basic facility, I mean, a reflex that they could never have just doing what

how athletes train today. Yeah. And it creates a real advantage. And I know that you did some

training with the Indiana Pacers, the professional basketball team. And I noticed, you know,

whether it’s kids, you know, growing up and getting excited about athletics and having an edge

excelling in athletics. Or for a lot of us in our adult years, you know, I myself am at a

computer a lot writing and communicating with folks, some of my shoulders. And this is back.

I think it’s basically this. It’s for kids of all ages. Yeah. And all walks of life. Love it.

You know, so no one ever addresses the musician, for example, about how to work out to become

your musician. Sure. Sure. Right. You just, but you get to your instruments. You’re doing scales

all the time and your, your, your nervous system is finally tapped in and you can do all this.

But unfortunately, if you don’t do anything for the body, what happens to you adapt to the

instrument that you plan? Right. You know, and this is more, uh, uh, this is a veteran panel

players posture right here. You know, after they, you know, I’ve got a dentist friend who’s

quite young and she’s already getting back issues from leaning over like this all the time working

on people. When you do that and you have a focus, it kind of like creates a form, you know,

it keeps the social form for it and it hardens. Yeah. Anyhow, this particular device is,

I’ve had like musicians come back and tell me, I don’t know what this is, but I’m writing different

kind of songs and I’m playing differently. Wow. So cool. So cool. I’m really, I’m excited. We’re

able to share this with our why on earth community. And uh, I wanted to ask what was it like working

with the, uh, with the Indiana Pacers? I mean, these are athletes at the top of their

game pun intended. Yeah. No, they are. They’re the most fascinating athletes I’ve ever seen,

because I’ve, I never really played basketball. And, um, except for, you know, during gym. Yeah.

And, uh, um, so I never watched the game as to really, uh, through my eyes of movement.

So after I started developing my sense of understanding structure and how it applied to martial arts

or yoga or different kind of bodies, that expressed. I noticed when I was working with the Indiana

Pacers is that these guys are freaking incredible athletes. Yeah. They’re like, like Rick Smith’s

was seven feet four or five inches tall. And he had, so one of the problems he had is his knees

were blown out, you know. And so I watched Rick run down court and he had this like wobble pretty

much at 23 and a half degree wobble like the earth, you know. So he was going like that. And I

said, well, that’s probably the knees right there because that’s where the, that’s where it’s

impacting. And so I worked with Rick with the liquid trainer as well as, uh, teaching him, uh,

suspension mechanics. So how to, how to, how to run down court, for example, where you don’t have

a line, where you come into your court and you allow your core to extend. This is something that

within a dawn, one books with Carlos Castanero, the power of the gate.

Well, he learned it. And when I, when it came to playoffs, I noticed he didn’t have any knee pads

and he no longer had the wobble. So I thought, oh, that’s kind of cool. So working with these

particular athletes, uh, it’s, they, they’re naturally think this is so developed. It’s like at

the eye, they have to do everything equally left, equally right. I mean, a lay up has to be done

equally both ways or the pace scale was right down, you know. And so what I find in, uh,

in watching that sport is they have to start real fast, stop, turn, jump up, land,

hopefully not on someone else’s foot so they could twist an ankle. Yeah, right. You know,

or the other person get a broken foot, you know. Yeah. That’s a shock on Neil 300 pounds going up

from the lap and coming down on your foot. Right, right. So they, you know, I didn’t see one practice

ever where somebody didn’t draw blood. Yeah. It was always like that rough. I say, Holy smokes,

I never seen basketball from this point of view. Yeah. Yeah. So it was really fun to teach them

because they learned very fast that anyone who has a kinesthetic sense of development at that level

learns that’s almost immediately, you know. And people who still need kind of a lot of like

coordination or steps to get a better coordination, it takes them a little time to, uh, to learn

the movements left and right equally because they rely so much on dominant side that they have to

educate the left side. And once that’s broken free, then all of a sudden, everything starts to change.

You have a left and right brain coordination and you have a left and right hemisphere coordination.

And not to mention a much greater range of motion in all joints, ankles, knees, hips. It’s amazing.

It’s absolutely wonderful. Well, let me, uh, let me just remind our audience that, uh,

this is the Y on Earth community podcast. And today we’re visiting with Ron Lamire, the founder

And speaking of waters and speaking of lifetimes, this time you spent with John Denver,

including when you guys were aboard the Calypso with Jacques Cousteau.

Obviously, what was a tremendous period in your life, Ron. And I’ve heard you share some of your

stories and experiences with me. And I wanted to give our audience an idea of what that was like

back back during those years, spending time up at Starwood and up in the Aspen Snowmass area.

You know, there was so much happening then that has really deeply influenced our sustainability

movement. A lot of folks may not understand what was all those connections that were being made

back in the 70s and 80s, but so much was happening that has really helped our world in a lot of

different ways, right? Yeah. At the time, so I met this guy, you know, I became one of my clients

here and he lived in Aspen. And one day he calls me and says, you know, a friend that could really

use your work, but he lives here in Aspen. And I said, you know, I got a buddy that’s coming up,

this coming weekend, we can do something then. I mean, I have never been to Aspen. I really

like to see it. And he says, sure, it’s really arranged. It’s the time that I didn’t think anything

of it. Yeah. So I get to my friend, Scottie Halleson, brought me there with his van and then

dropped me off at one of his friends house. It was the first time I was in Aspen. This was in

later December. And it was minus 20 degrees out. Wow. Almost as cold as it is right now.

That was like, yeah, there’s a storm blowing in. It was warmer earlier. Now it’s coming from

the mountains. We’re feeling it. So anyhow, I didn’t have a car. And Scott that night tells

my friend, asked my friend, Jimmy, when he says, Jimmy says, you get a car and you can lend

Ron. He’s got a, we just found out he’s got to get a treatment with John Zimmer some more.

He says, ah, he said, I only get two cars in the back. He says, they’re 1956

Cadillac. I got a pink Cadillac with no roof on it. But it starts, it starts every single time.

And I got a white Cadillac with a roof, but I can’t get it going. So you didn’t have to use the

pink Cadillac. It’s convertible. It’s convertible. I said, sure, no problem. So, but the next day,

I’m going up, you know, McLean flats up at the Starwood. And it’s freaking cold. You know,

I mean, I’m like, my ears like numb. And I get to the gate and the guy says, ah, what do you want?

I said, I got an appointment with John Denver. So he calls John. And I could hear and say, John,

I got a real life one outside here. Says he claims that he’s got an appointment with you.

Which is the name? And he asked my name. I said, Ron Lamir. He said, oh, yes, send him right up.

So I’m driving him to finally get to the back and to his driveway. And there’s John.

He’s kind of waiting for me with his arms crossed like this. And as I stopped the car, he kind

of expects the car goes all the way around, comes back to the window. That’s even make any mention

of no top, you know, he says, cool wheels, man. And that kind of broke the ice. And so I stayed with

him for the next three days, three days, three nights. He helped him to understand why his back was

the way it was. And as he was sharing with me about his life, because I didn’t really know that

much about John except for hearing that song coming in. Yeah, yeah. I was telling him what was going

on in Boulder and about cooking. And I said, you’re really, you’re in desperate means if you have

to stay with restaurants everywhere you go. Right. You know, I says, I remember when I was in

California, I made up with the Grateful Dead’s cooks. And those guys are on special diets wherever they

travel. I should say on natural foods, wherever they travel. Right. Right. So he was a really good idea

for him. Yeah. He came back to me and said, you know, my friend Tom Crom, who was his co-founder of

Windstar, he’s been more time at Windstar and he kind of runs security. He could, you could be on

a road with him for a couple of months and take over his position. Yeah. Because you had this

fighting background, you know, you did some boxing and stuff like that. And so yeah,

you came up with some ideas. And I got a big trunk with pots and pans, you know, like

pressure cookers, walks and had brown rice and miso, seaweed, tamari, all kinds of different

condiments to go along. Wow. And got a three burner Coleman fuel stove. And on February 21, he called

me to fly me to Houston on February 22, which was my birthday. It was just, it was just coincidental.

So from that time on, on my birthday, in 1980, until I’m throughout the 80s, I was a cook,

the therapist and his bodyguard, or I was a head of security, you know. And wow, it’s just like

opened another window. You know, Boulder was one. That was the bag of tricks that it took along

with me because everybody that worked with John literally had a bag of tricks because they were

their own musician, whether they were management, whatever. He had a good team around him. A lot of

skill. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. And so every day I cooked a meal, seven or eight course meal for

about 12 people, you know, on the three burner Coleman fuel stove. That was so great. Yeah, we

called both people. The boat people? Oh, that is amazing. That is amazing. And tell us the story.

And I know we should probably get you demonstrating the liquid trainer. It’ll warm us up a little

too. Yeah, warm me up. You know, do you want to do that first and then tell the story about

Jacques Cousteau or how would you like to do that? Well, let me see. May I take away with a story?

So I was telling Aaron, I met Aaron at our day and we talked a lot about it. Our day started out

as Aspen Renewable Energy Day and it has almost 20 years now of an annual conference with all kinds

of innovators, leaders, scientists, folks working on climate action and soil regeneration in

all manners of sustainability and wellness. So just so folks know what that is. Yeah. That’s

what that is. And now it makes me segue into this other thing is this guy named Chip Cummins,

who’s the guy who’s the author of that. Who’s been on a podcast episode? Chip, Chip,

put it on an episode. Hey, how Chip was with Malcolm at the time that John passed away.

And he was in one of the lower houses. So he and Malcolm went up to the house and Chip spent

some time in John’s music room. And then Chip was telling me, he says, I had all these downloads,

man. It’s like John was right there telling me. And Chip, he had the time we had the winter start

symposium every summer. There was a choices for the future symposium in Aspen. And that was done

with Tom Crom and John and Buckminster Fuller. It always really abarmed God people.

That would do this and it would talk about really where the state of the world is as far as the

environment is concerned. And so after John passed away, there was a lag. There was nobody,

nobody picked it up. Anyhow, Chip Cummins, I just want to honor him for taking the lineage from

John and just continuing to do our day. So great. I’ll be sure to send Chip a message when this

episode’s published and give him a heads up. And so you know, working with John, I got exposed to

a lot of his concerns around the environment. I consider him to be truly one of the more powerful

environmental voices he began so many things. One of the influences that really shifted him was

when he was on the Calypso, was Jacques. And Jacques was one of these guys that was a cold

inventor of like the aqua lung or where you could go into each water and stay there for quite a

long time with the holes, you know. And he took a lot of pictures. So John was going out in the

Calypso, was Jacques and Jacques took him down and showed him some pictures, some photos, some

movies that he had done like 20 years ago. And they were like incredible underwater scenes of

just, you know, treat like kelp fields, dolphins fields. They were seaweed was just total rhythm in

them. All these different coral reefs and fish that were, I mean, it was an incredible aquatic

metropolis. It was amazing. So Jacques was saying, John, I’m going to take you now to that same place.

I want to show it to you so you can see it now. And John was really excited. He had like a lot of

energy around that to see such beauty. So he gets in the suit and he goes down there and what he sees

is a barren desert. It was all gone. It was just gone. And that was shocking to John

as anything was to make him understand that we’re not the proper custodians for our planet.

We need to kind of tune into some of the, the sightleties of how nature works,

be aware of how species are disappearing. And in his music and many of his songs, he represents

the animals. He represents the whales, the dolphins. He represents all of that. He voices it through.

And it’s really powerful. And if you don’t know that yet, listen. They’ve got some John

Devar music. One of the albums that I felt was really very environmentally censored was also

when he did an album with Rita and the Whalers. And they did a reggae song called World Game. So when

you hear that, it’s called World Game. World Game. All right. And that was an incredible message.

You know, I want to play in the world game. I want to make sure that everybody knows the score

about using less and doing so much more. And that’s just the course. So if you start listening to

some of these words, you’re going to go, oh man, this guy was pretty hip for understanding

things about the environment. So I really appreciated that. Anyhow, I’ve got a chance to bring

this thing on the road towards the end of my time, John. It’s so great. Why don’t we show folks

some of your moves here? And hopefully that’ll warm you up a few degrees. It’s definitely cool

and down right now. Kali, we weren’t expecting that.

Right here. Yeah, let me just make sure it’s a good frame on you there. And then we can get going

with this run. This is so cool. Yeah, that’s perfect. How wide do I have? You’re good.

Am I am I so good? You just went out of frame right there. A whole frame? You’re in now.

You want me to scoop back a little? Yep. We’re going to back up just a hair.

Thank you.

Ready? Good.

Okay, so this is a liquid trainer. All you got to do is learn how to move the water from one

end to the next. You can do it very easily or you can do a wrist movement and speed it up.

Anyhow, after you learn certain movements, you’ll be able to just follow the water.

This is the shoulder movement that I was teaching my clients way back in the day.

Anyone who would learn this movement, this particular movement is called the crawl and swimming.

We’ll never have arthritis. And the reason why is a lot of times when we do these movements,

the capsule is contracted. When you toss the water down, it pulls your arm up. So what happens is

you’re kind of taking all the tension out of it, doing a full circumduction of the shoulder.

And by doing this, you’re repattering that movement so that it works a lot more fluidly in the capsule.

If I was going to be a baseball player and I needed something to I would simulate this movement.

Tossing. Fastball. Side on. Fastball. If I was a golfer, I could simulate an exact swing.

By doing it, I don’t just do it one side. I don’t do my dominant side. I do it equally on both sides.

What that does, it decompresses the dominant side and educates the receptive side.

They beat, they interchange their dominance and receptivities. As a result, you have what you

call neuroplasticity. The brain is receiving more information. And it’s not just the left brain.

It’s the right brain. So, is it cardiovascular? Yes, I can tell you that right now. That’s what I just did.

In doing this, probably if you get past the first lesson, you actually can learn it.

And I know that you can. If you actually learn the eight stationary movements, you’ll be able to

link them all together. So, the point where it’ll become one continuous movement. And when it

becomes one continuous movement, you’ll never, ever want to not use this. Because a couple things

it’s fun. And it’s quite a workout. So, I’m doing this talking with you. I don’t even have to

think about it. I’m just doing it. Meanwhile, it’s like setting a metronome. And my body is grounded

in ground reaction force. The pivot’s properly. And then a mean while I’m just

spinning around my axis, opening up the rectus finai. And the water wants me to go a little further

each time. But that’s where I have to be smart about it and just keep it within. So, there’s all

any different movements. Every plate of motion in the body is used. And Ron, how often would you

recommend folks use this week to week? That’s a great question. Because we are kind of like

conditioned to say, oh, we work out at so many hours a day or so many minutes a day or at this

hour or this is one of these things. And if you consider it to be like an appendage and you

happen to do things, you take it to the office with you. If you’re going to be on a computer for

an hour or so, you might want to take a break and just do some movements to reorganize the tissue

of the muscles and the nervous system that controls it. So, you can use it any time. I find that

with the level that I work at, which is pretty much knowing the movements. If I do a workout for

15 minutes, it’s like beyond anything that I’ve ever done. And I don’t know a system that can

match it. If you were an athlete and you were in competition and you could simulate the movements

you’re you most adapt to, you’ll use it quite often. You’ll use it five or six times a day.

Like a golfer, for example. Think about it. I’m not at a golf course right now, but I can stimulate

the movement because I can do that. If I do it five or six times a day when I approach a ball

with the club, it’s the same movement. And so, there’s like, you’re always, you’re always bringing

yourself to core. You’re always developing a greater core intelligence for whatever you’re doing,

whether it’s running, swimming, any athletic sport, dance, martial arts, and in yoga, I would say,

if you did this before you’re awesome as you might find a pleasant surprise, how easy it is to

do your awesome. That’s a great tip, a great insider tip of wisdom there. Let me ask when folks

buy their liquid trainer, how will they learn the different moves and forms? When they learn it,

it comes with level one and level two. So, you can, once you tap into the website,

then you go to the movements. You’ll have your bag, your liquid trainer, and then you go to the

movements and you’ll just follow the directions there, and it’s all as if I’m teaching you personally.

We have, I’ve worked with this thing for the last 35 years, and so whenever I teach anyone,

I always teach them as if it was exactly a mirror, and that’s how you’ll learn these

particular movements. Every movement is with me directly on, and I do it really slowly. So,

you can pretty much learn it, and if it’s too fast, you can always press pause back, get up a little

and practice, but get pretty simple really, especially if you put the time in to learn it,

you’ll get 10 times a reward. This is so great, Ron, and I just, I’m going to jump back on camera

with you and just remind folks that because Ron has made liquid trainer a part of our

why on earth community regenerative economic ecosystem, you get a 20% discount when you go to

liquidtrainer.com. You can also connect with Ron on LinkedIn, and it’s Ron Lamire-liquid trainer,

and we’ll of course put these links in the show notes for you. And Ron, it’s been such a joy

chatting with you today and sharing this with our audience and it has gotten really cold. I’m

amazed by how cold it got here while we’ve been chatting, and I guess this storm that’s coming in

is something, but- I’ll just bring in some snow. Yeah, we’re getting some snow probably soon.

I just before we sign off for today, just wanted to invite you, Ron, if there’s anything else

you’d like to share with our audience or mention. Oh, there’s 20 things to mention. We’d like to do this

another time. If you’re inclined to go forward and looking at all the sponsors that we have and

all that I was working with either, I’m very akin to loving the Crystal Society. So you can look

into the Crystal Society and learn a lot about the ocean through one of our great-grandfathers.

That’s great. I’ll make a note of Kustos Society and put a link in the show notes for that as well.

Or Ron, we’re really excited to be connected even more deeply with you now and to collaborating in

the coming months and years. And thank you so much for sharing your liquid trainer with us.

My pleasure. We’ll see you later. Bye everybody. Take care.
