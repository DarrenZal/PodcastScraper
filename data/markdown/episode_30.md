Welcome to the YonEarth communities stewardship and sustainability podcast series.

Today we have the opportunity to visit with Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis, hi Jandel.

It is so wonderful to have you with us today.

It is so cool to have this opportunity, thanks.

Thank you.

So Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis is the president and CEO of Crank Hospital in Denver, Colorado.

A world-renowned rehabilitation hospital that exclusively specializes in the neurorehabilitation

and research of patients with spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries.

Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis was the vice president of government, external relations and research

for Kaiser Permanente, Colorado, from 2009 to 2018.

And in that role, she led the organization’s government relations and regulatory affairs,

community relations and community benefit investment, clinical research activities, stakeholder

engagement, communications and advertising and marketing functions, a little busy.

And Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis is board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and was active in practice

for 25 years.

She’s a graduate of Dartmouth College and Dartmouth Medical School and completed her residency

at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.

Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis is also a very active participant in the community and currently serves on the

boards of the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, the National

Jewish Health, Mile High United Way, and the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.

It might pronounce you not correctly.

It’s Dr. Suss, be our geisel.

Be our geisel, right?

She is married and has two children and as I’m sure you can gather from this brief bio,

Mandela is extremely busy and with that especially in mind, thank you so much for joining us

today for this conversation.

I’m honored and privileged, so it’s all good.

It’s all good.

Well, I’m so excited to dive in.

We’ve been chatting a bit about the connections between the work that you’re doing clinically

with the patients and your role in the leadership position of this organization and I think

there are insights we will be gleaning that apply potentially to all of our lives and

roles in the world and I guess diving in, will you just tell us a bit about your role

and what you’re doing here?

So, well, thanks Aaron.

I’ve been at Craig Mount.

Tomorrow will be five months, so this is new work and if it proves anything, it’s that

you just never know what doors are going to open because even sort of hear what I’ve

done in my life and 25 years I actually practiced.

I took care of women and families in terms of Tetris and Gynecology to think that a door

would open where you’d find yourself at some point A, C, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E,

although we have rehab hospital D or C, as a, as a, I don’t beat you way in.

It’s like it doesn’t make sense and yet when I look through the rear view mirror, there

is such logic to how I find myself here and it does have to do with all the experiences

that I’ve had and in particular the clinical experiences, let alone the technical and

even sort of the, I’d say grooming in a sense that’s gone on over these last nine years

but who knew.

It does make sense but at the heart of it, for me it makes sense because I have a firm

belief that one of my roles on this earth is to be a warrior for the underdog, for the

vulnerable.

So, and I had to, I had to figure that out because I get and have had over the years, you

know, emails or phone calls about roles that are opening up in other organizations and

I love Kaiser Permanente.

It was there for 24 and a half years and most of that time that’s a clinician in practice.

So, why this one appealed to me when I was called and by the way, the first time I was

called, I gave the guy the recruiter names and hung up and then we’ll be yelled at and

encouraged by a friend that he won’t talk to me, he got me.

And so then as I really got to understand a little bit more about this gem, which interestingly

I knew was here, I knew they did rehab, I never thought about it any beyond that, I wasn’t

in that part of patient care so I had no idea what they even rehabbed and it worked.

But the more I learned, I said, yeah, let’s have a conversation and then when I knew that

I needed to do this interview, I said, you’ve got to be able to tell people why you want

Slow down long enough, why is this so attractive to you?

Because it wasn’t about money, it certainly wasn’t about title or position.

It was, there was something else and so that was when it hit me that it’s because this

patient population represents a level of vulnerability that needs a voice, needs someone to

be their face in community and through the recognition of this, it’s a social, the way

that we treat people in wheelchairs and with brain injury, we marginalize them and I had

to even sort of face that myself, it’s not that I ever thought, oh, you’re awful or

I don’t like you or that, but we cease to see them, we see them as less than and we forget

and that’s what it hit me is that these are people who woke up with one reality and are

going to bed with a very different one.

And all of us are one accident away, that’s what we have to realize is that we are all

potentially could find ourselves at a crag.

And then you’re not at crag forever and then you get to go home and home to what and

our community is welcoming and are they safe and are they accessible and all the other

sorts of things we need to think about.

It just got my social justice hackles and my sense of being a warrior for the vulnerable

coupled with the healing and the healer in me who doesn’t touch these patients, not

I’m not a clinician in this role, but the idea of being back with patients and sort

of thinking about what I can bring after, you know, through all those years where I was

caring for folks to this work, it is so logical that I’m here.

And as a leader, there’s something about this particular culture at crag, the hospital,

how we serve our patients, but I told everybody I had never been in a place that’s more patient

and family centered in terms of care.

How we care about and think about our patients in this holistic, introgative action, that totally

gets me jazz.

It’s just amazing, as I shared with you previously, a dear friend of mine was here at crag

a few years ago and he has recovered in such a beautiful way and I remember visiting

him just within a couple days after his accident here and it was one of the most unusual experiences

in my life to see him need to rebuild memory, rebuild story and identity.

And I’m struck here and you talk about your role in the position of leadership as the

CEO of this institution that is on the one hand through so many clinicians and professionals

providing this incredible service to all of these vulnerable individuals.

And on the other hand, you’re bringing along the board and other stakeholders in the institution.

And I imagine that your capacity for storytelling and for relating to these different constituents

is a huge part of your efficacy as a leader and I was wondering if you might speak to

that a bit because I think our audience would really learn a lot about that.

Well, first of all, we know, and I’m going to be a little scientific or something for a minute

here, that if you want to watch people literally lean in, let alone figuratively lean in,

link data and information to stories.

There’s some kind of story telling, I like to call those campfire moments where you’re

in a groove, you’re in a rhythm, you’re talking about things.

And it’s so much fun when some flash of something comes and I say, I have a story about that

or I remember once, blah, blah, blah, and then bringing it back home.

What excites me, and it’s one of the many things that it excites me, is thinking about

the stories that I get to build over this next many, many years, I hope that I’m here

at Craig, that we’ll serve our patients and serve the world in some way.

It’ll be kind of cool, but probably one of the coolest, I think, things that I decided

some years ago, as I have been this art and student of leadership, let alone these amazing

the privilege and honor of leading in a lot of different ways.

Years ago, it was 2014, I said, or actually before 2014, I said, I am going to one day

write a book.

I want to write a book entitled, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned

in the care of patients.

I figured it out because when leading my last team, the team I had as a vice president

at KP, I found myself always using clinical examples as metaphor for what we were doing.

I mean, one of my favorite questions to ask the team when trying to get a sense of how

was the health and well-being of the teams that these folks led doing, or going, I’d

say, who’s in your ICU, who’s in your ICU, I’m going to get this look and they go, who

is literally sick, who has some toxin in terms of either how they’re showing up or being

in the presence of the folks on a team in a way that they’re spreading negativity like

and it is a toxin or a virus who’s ill that way, who is struggling with something that

we need to, just like in an ICU, shepherd the resources to figure out what to do, to

help them either out, help them out or help them out, and that’s the reality in all institutions

too that we help them out or help them out, and so that was one, and there were loads

of those sorts of ways that I thought about things.

In fact, when I told myself, tell you another great one is that when I first started that

job nine and a half years ago, that was 2009, and you may remember in 2010, the Affordable

Care Act passed, and even early in nine, but I had this crazy talk about a learning curve,

like a baptism by fire for government, the government relations part of things, and I would

have to tell myself, I remember saying, you know, when the media called, for example, because

I had media relations and this was relatively new for me, even though we had somebody who was on

the team who did media, she’s going to bring it all to you, you know, a panel or he’s going to

bring it all to you, and I would have to ask myself, is there blood on the floor?

Now, what do I mean?

So I’m an obstetrician, there’s blood, there’s a lot of blood in obstetrics, and there can be

whether it’s a C-section or a vaginal delivery, or even, unfortunately, sometime in gynecologic

surgery, and what you learn to do over a career, as you get comfortable with what you’re doing,

is you learn to know when your pulse should quicken, or to recognize when this is a high

drama moment, this is an emergency, that kind of thing, and when you’ve got time or you can

pace things differently, and by the way, the more that you do, the less you see that you’re

pulse, that you have to react like, oh my god, because you learn, you know how to end with.

Well, I had to tell somebody, my phrase, when I got over to that side of the business and

started doing no more clinical, is all of this stuff is new, and when it’s new,

it seems like there’s blood on the floor everywhere, right? So I’d have to slow my roll and say,

is there blood on the floor? And then just do a quick assessment, and sometimes you use others

to help you assess it, those who live the work longer, and then just say, chill, you’ve got this,

you’ve got people who will help you out of it, and that’s exactly how the good clinicians practice

too, is they didn’t look at it as this is mine to solve, I play my role, I play my role well,

and I’ve got team members who together we’re going to figure things out, and so you begin to,

so that’s another example of this use of story, and then you can say, oh yeah, I remember

this one case, and then you’re not carrying all of the weight yourself as a solo operator.

And you’re learning, and you know how to react, and the one thing that I think is so so important,

both as a physician, and as a leader, is coupled with authenticity about when things are really

icky, having to be honest, and transparent, and that was real important with patients, don’t lie,

never lie, never sugarcoat, but this notion of authenticity and transparency in the face of

some icky-ness, but you never, ever, ever lose hope, so my role is to be calm under fire, and to

provide those signs in the environment that things are going well, because that’s, so partly,

there’s this book, Strength Space Leadership, that was written by the guy, is it Wrath, who did

also wrote, Strength Finders, and he wrote a follow-on to that called Strength Space Leadership,

and he, and it’s one of the gallop books, and that organization studies everything, and you know,

surveys everything, and he talked about or described that the, he has a chapter on the needs of

followers, and he said, what followers need is hope, compassion, stability, and trust, and we can

always, always infuse that, even in the icky-est of times, and that’s the case when I’m having to tell

somebody that their baby’s died, that’s the case when I got to tell somebody, you’re not,

you’re not going to make it here, and you know, in this particular role you’re in, that’s the case

when you have to tell a patient your problems are of your own making, I’m here to help you,

let’s work together on whatever it is, that’s the case in management leadership when you’re dealing

with a performance issue, with someone, I’m not, I always want to be compassionate, and I want to

be gentle, I want to make sure that they, they sense my sense of confidence that they can do,

that’s the whole part, and that the ground’s not shaken underneath you, even though nobody likes,

nobody wakes up in the morning and he goes to work, it says, I hope somebody tells me I slept

today, so, and, and, and no patient, nobody wakes up in the morning saying, I think I want to be a

patient, so, you know, I think there are really some cool parallels between what I learned at the

feet of my patients, that informs how I show up as a leader, so, yeah, yeah, you were mentioning

to me earlier this afternoon that you see your role as a clinician interacting with patients

often as similar to being a personal coach, or a life coach, and it sounds like you do the very

same thing with your colleagues and the folks working in the organization under your authority,

and that’s probably a skill we develop over time, and when it’s well developed, it’s a remarkably

powerful skill. Yeah, you know what’s funny, I had a colleague some years ago who I’ll never forget

this line, that we, we give to physicians, you know, a whole lot of, you know, sort of homage,

or sort of a sense of omniscience, or that, that is not true, and in healthcare, there is

what we know a lot, and we continue to learn more and more about, you know, sort of whether it is

biomes of all sorts, or genomes, or your name, let alone in this space that I get to work in now,

how this thing called the brain works, and you’re learning more and more, and we don’t, we use

such a tiny component, you know, portion of it, all these things, like we’ve known forever,

just drive more questions, and that has the power to humiliate, which is good, keep a humble,

keep a very humble in terms of, yeah, you, you answer question and seven more pop up on that topic,

and so one of the really cool things about what I get to do here, as a docket, it was the same

there, it’s this notion of, you know what you know, but you don’t know what you don’t know,

and I don’t know anything, I’m learning, I’ll be a little silly, but I’m learning how the,

you know, the science is brain and spinal cord injury, in part, because I’m curious and interested,

but what I get to do when I walk the halls, our patients stay here for, you know,

months, weeks for sure, and months in some cases, so I get to see them along their journey,

but some from the moment they arrive, if I’m asked to make sure I check in on somebody,

but others I’ve just gotten more and more comfortable at just walking up the folks in the hall,

and saying hello, because they’re going to be here, we’re in a real bond, so I get friends around here,

and I get to see their progress, because I don’t see them every day, and I think one of the coolest

contributions I can make, I like to think to their recovery, or that notion of hope,

compassion, stability, and trust, is when I see them, I do see them, I get to see the miracles,

I get to see the miracles, I get to watch the recovery, but I’m not, you know, the one who’s

seeing it incrementally day after day, and to be able to say, oh my god, look what you can do,

wow, beautiful, this is, this is amazing, because they can’t see it, you know, I just, you know,

you can’t see it, and when I was in clinical practice telling a patient, you know, who I might have

been rounding on the hospital every day, you’re going better, you’re doing better, it’s not, it’s

not the same as a week goes by, or when I see them back in the office at six weeks for a check,

it’s like, wow, look how much better you’re doing, so I get to do that here, the same goes for how

I think we need to think about coaching and growing our teams, is when we see, when we see

changes in terms of how they’re really leaning in to trying to get better at what they do,

point it out and tell them the stories and give them the examples that I saw you do on XYZ, that

was awesome, that kind of, so again, it’s that, I think one of our, our most important roles as a leader,

I like to say is these need to be three times as big as this, even though it’s right now, it’s not,

in this particular, it’s a bug, yeah, it’d be a mess if I was quiet, it wouldn’t work, it wouldn’t work,

but so it’s to use all those other senses, which we also do in medicine, by the way,

use all those other senses to help lead the environment, and so it’s kind of a cool thing to get

the walk around these halls and watch patients get better and know that through that lens of hope,

compassion, stability, and trust, how are you helping them to see what they can’t see,

and the thing goes through the folks that you get to work alongside.

It’s beautiful, what I’m hearing is sometimes this perspective that you can bring in your position

that is less frequent than some of the other interactions and interactors, brings a special

potency to it, and it makes me think of that phrase less as more, and occasionally when I’m working

with executive teams and folks that I’m helping in the realm of leadership and sustainability,

I will tell them, you don’t want me with you every day of the week, I will actually be less

effective for you that way, and not that that’s necessarily true for each and every one of us in

each and every positions we can play in the world, but it does seem in certain positions that

occasional touchpoint becomes almost homeopathic in nature, it becomes such a strong

opportunity for reflection, for change, for feedback, and so forth, and what I’m hearing is you do

this routinely in your work.

I’ll say something that sounds anything but humble, I think it’s how it’s just who I am,

and I know you didn’t ask, I do it routinely in work, but it says natural is breathing if you just

let it be, if you don’t feel like you as a leader need to walk around buttoned up or you have some

sort of sense of the archetype, some archetype of what a leader is, is anything other than just,

you know, a leader is someone who, first of all they are servants, we sit at the feet of the people,

we don’t lead people, we serve those people, and some of that serving a big dose of that is coaching

and mentoring and guidance, and then there’s inspiration and vision setting, and all the other

things we have to think about, but your your comment, gosh, it just maybe think of something,

it’ll come back, but yeah, we don’t see them, we don’t see them, it’ll come back, I totally lost it,

that’s okay. Well, let me, that’s actually a really funny segue for me to ask you another question,

I’m just burning to ask, so you’re working here in a setting where folks are dealing with

injuries and issues related to the brain and to neurology. I’ve heard it said, and I don’t know if

this is still considered true, but I’ve heard it said that we understand more about outer space

than we do about the brain and our own neurological systems, what’s going on with our

neurology? What is all this that allows us to interact the way we do communicate, learn, etc?

Well, he thinks I have the answer, but I’m going to write the test book, I’ll just make sure I share

it with people. Who knows, I think, when I think about that part of sort of life, what? I have

this, like my husband says I have a memory like an elephant, and I can remember things from

childhood, I remember songs, I remember poet, I mean things from tiny, tiny, I can remember

smells and being places and sort of a sense of even lighting of things as a little kid, and even

as I got older, and I find myself sometimes thinking if a song comes on the radio, and I was like,

where is that stored? How is that stored? Not alone. I mean, I think we get the why, or we’ve made

up a why as humans, the why is because there’s this iterative sort of forward nature and everything

that we’ve learned prepares us for whatever is next, so maybe it makes sense or has some

applicability, a lot of it doesn’t, but I don’t, I don’t, I say is it ones in zeros, I mean,

that’s what a computer would say, it’s ones in zeros. I don’t know, but there is something

magical about the brain, and the part of it that actually interests me more than the cerebral

cortex is the mid part of the brain, the more primitive parts of the brain, you know, they hit the

campus, in some of those places where we store our unconscious and our subconscious sort of

sense of things, the part that gets us to work every morning without killing anybody while we’re

talking on the phone, we should be, or you know how it is when you find yourself at work and say,

I have no idea how I got here, and so there is this, this other, I think we need to pay way more

attention to that, not only understanding neurologically what it is, but tapping into that to understand

our motivations, and what, what, what, you know, that notion of real self-knowledge, because it’s

back there, it’s not in these, you know, these big old cortices here, which we have the ability to

learn, but it’s the primitive parts that, and actually even the transfer of what we learn from here

that becomes subconscious, so that driving is of naturals, whatever, or these elite athletes can do

what they do without even thinking about it. There is the thing that excites me, and I know I won’t

be around to learn it all, because I think as I said, to answer one question and seven more pop up,

it is going to be exciting what we learn about the brain. I’ve heard stories, and one,

and I can’t remember who in the hospital told it to me, but a patient who after a severe brain

injury could suddenly do amazing art, and they didn’t do art before. So, you know, we recruit,

and we use the accommodating way that the brain sort of picks up where the other part, or comes in,

when another part goes out, is pretty remarkable. To hear our music, or our speech therapists,

and we have music therapy here, where we’re using music to help people learn how to count,

or to pace themselves when they’re walking, or to speak again, because that whole notion of

music comes from, I guess, a different part of the brain than necessarily, you know, the way that

we express, or even hear information around the parts of the brain warnecose and broke a

barrier. I remember that from school, and expressive and receptive a-fages, where you, if you

heard that part of your brain, you either don’t understand what people are saying, or you can’t express

it in a way that you can hear it. So, I mean, it’s just one complicated organ, and I find myself

thinking, then how does, and complex? How does it recover? This is all the cool stuff that,

you know, we’re going to figure stuff out, and the pace at which we’re figuring stuff out in

science, just in general, is remarkable. It’s accelerating so much. We may actually figure out a

whole lot before I leave this earth. Right, I hope so. You know, there’s a thread here we’re talking

about, and incredibly complex and adaptable organ, if we can call it that. We’re also, this is our

stewardship and sustainability podcast series, where we explore linkages between health and

well-being at the individual, the family, the community scale, and how that links up to global

scale issues of sustainability, regeneration, stewardship, etc. And I’m really curious about the

insights you might have around behavior change, and around adaptability, and our ability to

wake up one day, sometimes because we have to, not that we want to, and suddenly we’ve got a very

different situation, and we can learn to respond to that. I’m curious if we might take some cues

and more proactively choose behavior change as well. These are some of these broad and complex

issues we face as a society, but I’m just curious on this topic of adaptability and behavior change

if anything comes to mind for you. You know, it’s one of the words that

saying before we got started that we had this amazing conversation as a group of 20 or so.

Actually, the word now goes 24, 25 leaders today. On what makes Craig so special, they talk about

this thing called the Craig culture, and back in 2004, the then CEO, actually the first CEO of

this remarkable place of the modern Craig. This Craig’s been around since 1907, but

penned along with the number of other folks in the organization, this thing called the Craig

Recipe, and it’s like, what makes this place of darn special, and what makes it hum? And I happened

to find it at a drawer right after I started here, and I just got this huge smile. I said, my gosh,

I’ve been here maybe two or three weeks when I read this and said, the gosh, a place still

functions like this. And I don’t even know that many people even, you know, there’s an upturn

over in workforce, even though we certainly have some people with long tenders that there’s a lot

of people who’ve never even seen this, and I can tell you, but this thing is hardwired. Hardwired

is can be. And so when we have this great discussion that they about, why does it endure?

What do we need to think about adding in terms of, you know, in light of changing,

the changing external environment and even internal environment? And are these still the right,

is this still the right recipe? And so far then listening to this incredibly

committed group of people talk, and leaders talk about this topic. First of all, it’s cool to

watch that happen. I think this doesn’t happen in most organizations where we make the time to

have a discussion like this, as leaders, and think about what’s our accountability and responsibility

to lead and to serve. But I went to this place of thinking about organizations as trees,

I love trees, but trees and really that notion of the metaphor of the roots. I mean, what is the

substrate that makes this possible, that makes this sustainable? And of course, then you get this

sort of heavy feeling and don’t screw it up, Alan Davis. Don’t let it go. But I threw into the

room a few things. It strikes me that it’s things like resilience and adaptability and joy and

determination and hope. And then someone else said, you know, this notion of, we come to work here

out of a real sense of, oh god, we know that the notion of generosity will come in a minute.

But you really want to help these folks in a way that is a sit. And then what hit me was,

as I said, this is the most these folks are like there’s nobody more vulnerable than someone who is in one of these horrific

catastrophic accidents who often can’t feed themselves when they first you know can’t go to the

bathroom all these things that we take so for granted and our job is to to help restore that

obviously rehab get people that using adaptability and resilience but also hope and

celebrating the small victories through a lens of joy and I see determination like I’ve never

seen I mean there’s something about these accidents when they happen to people that many say

they didn’t wake up wanting it to happen but they never want to go back to the way they were

before because of what they have tapped into in terms of their you know parts of them back to

what is there literally their brain or their you know their neurologic system in terms of you

know the compensatory things that can happen in this space but it’s more that what they discover

about themselves that they didn’t know or because this is a place that has lots of has access to

and provides sort of this holistic team based approach to care there are things that insurance

doesn’t pay for but that we have these amazing donors who allow for life therapeutic recreation

where people but they have they have these outings and one of the weekends outings too

ago was to go do archery cool cool I’d like to do that yeah seriously and then people discover

that they can do things they didn’t know that they either have the capacity for or even in their

former life would have never had the opportunity to be exposed to these things so there’s this

there’s this you know it I told them at the end of my kind of thinking out loud saying I said

we live in a place with sort of this sort of sense of the contradiction in terms of

what you think you should feel and see in here here and what we actually do it’s there

and it’s it just blows me away that we do it and and because we do it I think it changes us

and I am convinced this sounds corny’s can be but it’s not true I think we are better because we

get to serve these patients and these families the way that we get to do so and do we in turn

then take that out to the world and what’s that look like in terms of our own relationships with

others who we get to hang with our families our friends we are changed by this just as much as

our patients are it is it’s so beautiful it’s palpable walking you can be okay yeah and you would

expect a facility like this to perhaps have a vibe of Debbie Downer or something like that right

but it’s not at all so folks are so friendly even down in the lobby I was struck it was like

encountering a handful of new friends you know what I told back to know a clinical reality

that translates beautifully into leadership and these folks just reinforce this belief for me

that I’ve had for a long time and I used to say it to and I do still say it to leaders and

folks is that our people want to see and be seen by them they want to be seen by and be seen by

us and you end up in a chair are you end up not being able to quite get the words out right are

you end up severely disabled and what people want more than anything else and this is what the

nuns taught me in Catholic schools it all life have dignity all work have dignity and you

want to still be treated in that same way you want to be received in that same way you don’t want

to be seen as lesser so I was real and comfortable at first when I came over just walking up to

people and in chairs and or our patients and saying hi in part because I felt like I was um

invading their privacy and then like nothing more than to say hi first of all everybody want

to know about how great it is here I get that but they want to know that you see and then I’ll

say I’m the presidency or I’m the president of the hospital I go oh I get touched by this it’s

not a big deal you know I put them on the same way you do or you know all we’re up you know this is

so so um yeah it’s uh people want to see and be seen by and the sense and our ability to open

up our hearts and sort of really be as vulnerable as our patients are you know to experience that

and to live that occupy that space in the same way that they do obviously without the physical

barriers but more just if you think about when that happens what’s that patient feeling fear

hopelessness shocked um worry concerned

there are things on that desk over there that can bring out the very same emotions in me

and what I’m looking for then somebody to see me or or to help me and so uh we get to do that here

and and I think that’s what I think that’s what the world is longing for is leaders who will

will show off that way because then they’ll help you people are willing to go to the wall for you

if they if you are willing to ask and to show your humanity and your humaneness

yeah beautiful well speaking of cultivating our leadership abilities capacities I’ll take the

opportunity to make a couple quick public service announcements um this is the YonEarth

communities stewardship and sustainability podcast series and we’re visiting today with

we’re going to be able to share with folks in May and through this podcast Jandel and

one of the things that strikes me as we’re talking through all of us there’s so much going on in the

if we can call it the microcosm of Craig Hospital and the folks that you’re serving here that can

really broadly apply to so many big system and big picture issues and challenges we’re facing

as a society and I remember speaking with you about this little four letter acronym and I

I remember a friend joking recently about TLA’s and having an aversion to TLA’s and I’m looking

down like with a TLA three letter acronym and I just couldn’t help but crack it so I guess this

is an FLA or letter acronym and it’s it’s VUCA and I think you for sure this with me a couple

of years ago when we were chatting and it’s it’s such a brilliant framework for understanding some

of the stressors really that we’re experiencing in life at every scale and then there’s sort of

a next step or or a companion acronym to go with VUCA as well and I was hoping you’d talk about

a tiny bit about that well VUCA spans for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity

and you know you hear those words and think what sort of naropa light plays came up with VUCA

it turns out it’s actually the military and it actually was a phrase that was coined in the

military in the post cold world cold war era yeah where I mean if you think we started fighting

and conflicts started looking different across the globe after the cold war thing and and only

heightened after 911 where you really don’t know where and I mean I it’s why we’ve seen so many more

brain injuries not only is that not just about the technology or the instruments of destruction

it’s that wars are fought and conflicts look different and it was engaged in it so the late 90s

they finally took this sort of started writing and really coined this VUCA phrase in the military

and then after 911 business picked up on it it sort of started getting out and I happened I

happened upon it quite by accident one day a few years ago on the internet and there is an

antidote to VUCA it’s vision understanding clarity and agility and you know I’m reminded of

another story fabulous there was and this is a story that maybe others know and it’s about

sense-making because if you think about vision understanding clarity and agility in the face of

volatility uncertainty and complexity what we have the opportunity to do and I dare say is

crazy as things can feel at any given point we have the obligation and responsibility to do

is to sense-make and so the story isn’t I’m gonna tell it wrong but I’m I’m gonna do it anyway

goes back to world war one and or two anyway back to one of the wars and one of the leaders sent

a group of see I don’t even know all the military things up Latuna band which is not even close

to right but the group of soldiers out on some sort of a mission and this was over in the Swiss

Alps I believe so they’re there and they do their thing and this snowstorm comes in and they get

terribly lost and they get a they get really freaked out they don’t know they’ve lost contact

with them back at base at the base the the leader is feeling terrible about you know

it’s been horribly guilty about this happening while they do end up the the the leader of this group

puttune and I will call that find a map in the bottom of his rucksack and they use this map and

they navigate themselves back and out and they’re in the hospital and they look at this map and

it wasn’t even a map of the Swiss Alps it was a map of the Pyrenees and so the the sort of moral of

the story is when you’re lost in a snowstorm any map will do when you’re lost in the forest any

map will do when you’re lost in your life any map will do when you’re lost and not quite sure

how to do what you know challenge is facing you any map will do and what that maps I mean you

can think of all the ways and what the things what did that give to them since it wasn’t them maybe

all mountains are the same as what it means but I kind of doubted it was the up in the down part

but beyond that who knows but what what what that gave them was a true north for the moment

pardon the pun some way of saying okay it gave them the sense of hope and confidence okay look we

found one let’s just follow this Luca does the Luca prime attempts to do the same thing in that

moment where you want to book your ramps you’re that you’re that afraid and and we all know

sometimes we can look cool as cucumbers on the surface and be scared spittless it can be a new

opportunity like this one where you go holy cow I don’t know what a CEO and a president does I

think they made the steak which was my January 1st crazy meltdown where you just sort of have

this moment where you go thinning steak oh my god I can’t do this job and then what you have to do

and I had to do with myself even in that case was to take a pill you know what you don’t know he

didn’t literally take a pill actually I waited till three o’clock and I knew that somewhere in the

world it was five o’clock I had a glass of wine yeah me clearly another aspect of the microbiome

we can be grateful for and then microbiome absolutely to out that’s right but what that story tells me

is that in those those moments where and you’ve got to have the intuition to know and people are

at that space and I think we are societally at that place yeah for sure right now we do have the

option to choose and that’s where these cerebral cortices do help because we can choose our reaction

to things and this notion of sense making providing the map telling yourself what you know and what

you don’t know um seeking as much clarity as you can about a thing recognizing that when things

actually are uncertain complex and ambiguous you’re not going to see a whole lot of clarity but

there’s a few things out there that tells you that the world is and just chart a course and and

take that course it gets back to my is there blood on the floor ask yourself is there really blood on

the floor um when there is do you have to figure out what is the response and I think given some of

the crazy that we’re all living in right now this isn’t where you answer the question no there’s no

blood on the floor there’s blood on the floor we then have to decide how do we want to engage

and react to that bloody floor yeah is it rantman raving on a Facebook post is it you know burning

signs is it doing whatever the heck is it or is it thinking about in my small

ecosystem my small community whatever that may be what are the things that we can say

and point to that things are actually there’s far more goodness going on than there is negativity

and where there is negativity how do you effectively use your voice to combat that

and what’s not destructive what’s not helpful and by the way secure your own oxygen mass first I

decided three days ago I am not listening to news for a while just can’t do it anymore yeah yeah

there was there was the end of last week and it was this whole thing it’s with this smaller

this artist the actor who did what he did where I was oh and then there was the coach from

the new England Patriots that’s what I said I can’t do this anymore I said I had this moment

where I realized this is like wallowing in like sort of taking in dirt every day or something what

is this doing to us on a cellular level yeah and that’s in that moment you have a choice

I said I mean it’s not like I’m gonna become some big ignoramus it’s not like I’m gonna ignore

what’s going on then I can choose what and when and how to take this in and I also can choose how

to react to it and so I think this notion of vuka that was a long way to tell the vuka story

you know a vision understanding clarity and agility it requires slowing down

requires part of some stuff off as I just said it requires throwing the agendas away at meetings

like we did today and just wrap it and having a wrap session for showing my age and allowing people

to put their voice in the room in a way that’s different because you know that it’s out of that

that there’s a sense of I can feel earth the earth is solid um we can see our way through this

and by the way while the world may be changing around us in healthcare we’ve got all the right

stuff to know how to weather the storm we got the map and we or we can make the map yeah we can

make the map we don’t have to wait for somebody you know just don’t sit by the side of the road

and wait rescuing nobody coming we can do this we can do this so yeah but so it’s it’s so

interesting I know we need to wrap up in just a couple minutes and there’s there’s one final

thread I just I know I would I would feel remiss if I didn’t ask this when I hear you talking about

the observational capacity is there blood on the floor when I hear you talking about the

sort of self regulating awareness that says it’s time to turn off the radio it’s time to turn

off the news when I hear you talking about uh being in a leadership meeting with 24 of your

senior team saying we need to throw the agenda out for a moment and do this other thing

what I’m hearing what I’m experiencing actually it’s kind of cool to feel is that there’s a

de-stressing there’s there’s a lowering of maybe even the stress hormones that would otherwise

respond to these things in a different way and I’m just curious if one of the keys in in all of

this that we’re discussing in our own lives and how we’re serving others and our roles as leaders

and in our responses to some of the big challenges that we’re seeing in the world if we each become

a bit more perhaps intelligent I don’t know if there’s a better word about managing that

neuro biochemical response system that we’ve got that that might be one of the kind of keys or

parts of the map or or something it absolutely is and you know so you can start from that space

of talking about we have the opportunity to choose our reaction it does start though with having

a deeper sense of where you are both physiologically emotionally mentally spiritually physically

in any given instance when sort of like there’s a there’s another old book that was written it’s

actually sort of a true story it’s called the House of God and it was written in the late 70s

and it’s about an intern going through his internship at the Beth Israel in Boston and he has

these rules there these House of God rules and one of the House of God rules is in an emergency
