## APPROACHING NEW ECONOMIC EPOCHS

In our current epoch, what Tom calls “Epoch 0,” our global economic activity is primarily extractive, and has embedded in it a dangerously destructive logic: “to run the economy, we must destroy the ecology.” In the next epoch (Epoch One), our economic activity will be “materially productive” instead of extractive, Tom asserts. Then in the subsequent epoch (Epoch Two), the global economy will be primarily focused around enriching ecosystem metabolics. Finally, in the most advanced economic epoch (Epoch Three), Tom predicts that we’ll be maximizing diverse nutrient flows and “savoring” each solar photon and each water molecule – all within the logical rubric of global commercial activity. These Epochs are discussed in further detail in the “State of the Planet” talk that Tom gave at a recent At One Ventures annual general meeting of shareholders. Tom has shared a Vimeo link to this talk – available in the show notes.

Welcome to the YonEarth community podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today

we’re visiting for a second time with technologist and financier Tom Chi. Hi, Tom.

Hey there. How are you today? Pretty good. I’m really looking forward to our

conversation and we’ve got a lot to cover obviously. Absolutely. Tom Chi is the

founder of At1 Ventures which has already deployed over a hundred million

dollars into several companies working on regeneration stewardship and

sustainability technologies. Some of these companies include iron ox which is

robotic agriculture, dendra systems which is drone tree planting, true which is

advanced air conditioning, wild earth, sustainable pet products, apes core 3D

printed low carbon geopolymer cement and robotic masonry, and several others.

And is in the middle now of a second fund which is looking to deploy

somewhere in the vicinity of 300 million dollars in the coming months and

quarters. And we’re so excited Tom to see the progress with all that you’re

doing with these important technologies and to hear that the first fund has

gone so well. And just in case some of our audience don’t know just to give a

little more on your background, you know Tom went to Cornell University and

prior to launching At1 Ventures did a number of technology projects and

products with companies like Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo Search, Google, etc. And was

involved in the Google Glass and Google self-driving car development

efforts. And so yeah we’re gonna have a lot of talk about today including some

specific technologies. Some of the view you have into the phases of our

economic development relative to sustainability technologies will chat a

little bit about AI even. And to kick things off Tom I just thought I’d ask you

openly, you know, how are things at At1 Ventures? And what’s happening that’s

got you excited at this time? Yeah things are going very well. We as you

mentioned, we raised 150 million fund one and we did 27 investments in that

fund and that fund is off to kind of a flying start, you know, relative to

peers that started in the same year around the same size were in the top two

percent and not just for a climate but for across all types of funds and all

types of sectors. So yeah just outperforming the market by quite a bit on that

front and we are mostly done raising a 300 million dollar fund to though

that is open until, you know, toward the end of July. Wonderful and I imagine

you’re already eyeing a number of investment opportunities and probably it’s

not at this stage appropriate to talk about many of them or any of them in

great detail but I’m curious if you’re seeing emerging trends in the

technology as it relates to sustainability as it relates to ecology restoration

as it relates to climate change mitigation. Are you seeing anything that’s

emerged in the last several months since you launched fund one? Well to be clear

we started fund one, you know, over three years ago at this point so there’s a

lot that we saw and a lot of it’s well represented in the portfolio of 27. For

fund two we did our first close and fund two last summer so we’ve already had

some time with fund two but you basically open up the fund raising window for a

little bit so you know there’s some time for folks to come in so we are

actually already have eight investments in fund two including for example the

first vaccine to protect honey bees ever created and also now USD approved as

of December of 22. Oh wow that’s interesting yeah there we know

colony collapse disorder has been one of the greatest threats to our global

food supply. I imagine you could speak to some of the facts and figures on that.

Absolutely and colony collapse disorder is basically a a rough way that people

have been kind of describing the output of things. Now sometimes it was related to

things like you know American Fowlbrood European Fowlbrood which is the types of

diseases that this vaccine protects against because those tend to be the types of

diseases where the whole hive fails at once as opposed to you know things that

hit individual bees but may not be as damaging to an entire hive. But if I

want to go help characterize the major stressors for bees there’s there’s

three major stressors. One of them is Neonicotoid pesticides which are widely

used all throughout North America. They’re kind of ostensibly banned in

Europe but there’s a lot of you know agriculture that is grandfathered in where

they continue to use it at pretty large scales effectively everywhere in the

world. Another one is a type of parasite called the Varro destructor mite which

like you know if you were to scale it up to a human size it’d be like the size of

a dinner plate on a human that’s like what you know like a 12 inch dinner

plate on a human. Like that’s how big it is compared to a bee proportionally.

And you know a bee can like live with one a mite but if it ends up with two

three mites then it’s kind of a metabolic drag at a level that it really weakens

everything about the mite. And then the sorry about the bee and then the third

category is these diseases which is the stuff that the vaccines are meant to

address. Yeah wow that’s great to hear. I’ve heard some many billions of

dollars worth of food production in some significant portion of everything we

consume as humans comes from the pollinated crops. Yeah so the majority of

biomass on the planet is actually angiosperms which are flowering plants

like 80 percent. And given that the role of pollinators you know just even

beyond the basic food system is enormous. And we have been both damaging the

pollinators within our food system and if folks really want to dive into

this the University of Maryland has been running the kind of the industry benchmark reports

in terms of annual bee losses from the commercial perspective. You can just you know

search the the words that would make sense given that sentence to be able to find it not too

hard to find. And you can kind of track the kind of losses that we’ve been having.

I’ll short circuit it and say that we’ve been losing 40 to 50 percent of the commercial bees

per year every single year. So it is very dramatically impactful to the industry. This is not a

thing where it’s like a minor hit and they’re just working around it easily. This is a thing that

is leading to a very bad situation because we have fewer and fewer bees which means we need

to split more hives in order to try to get more bees which actually reduces the genetic diversity

and then because we don’t have enough bees then we bring them all to a couple places you know

North America like most of the commercial bees in North America go to southern California for

for the almond the almond crop in January and February. And the combination of reducing genetic

diversity and then concentrating everybody in the same spot at the same time that’s like a recipe

for a total collapse. Anyway put that aside for a second. That’s just the commercial stuff.

In the larger picture of the you know 80 percent you know biomass that is flowering plants

then it means that all these pollinators are out there not just the honey bees but there’s all

these pollinators that are out there that are critical to biodiversity on the planet and because of

the way that we’ve been doing agriculture and because of how widespread agricultural practices

across the world then we have been both killing the honey bees which you know we obviously keep

you know better stats on but we are accidentally killing a bunch of pollinators and for you know if

you follow the work of Charles Darwin then you’ll know about like the the moth with the 11-inch

proviscus and he kind of theorized that this moth must exist because there’s a plant with like a

you know like a 10 or 11 inch like you know like depth that you would need to get to you to be able

to successfully pollinate it and actually a lot of life on earth is like that where there is literally

only one pollinator or there might be a primary that does 90 percent of it in a secondary that does

10 percent of it and what has been happening is we have been accidentally extincting or massively

impacting the the populations of plants around the planet by hitting pollinators that weren’t even

what we’re trying to hit with our pesticides right we were trying to go deal with some some specific

agricultural pests in the field not these pollinators but we have been kind of hidden in across the

board and it is both affecting you know the biodiversity of those pollinators of course directly

but also what they pollinate a bunch of species are starting to go extinct because we just killed

all their pollinators. Yeah we did an episode a while back with Scott Black the executive director

of the zersi society that’s doing so much to help educate and mobilize the public around

these issues with pollinators and other invertebrates specifically and just recently was also

interviewing a Chelsea Green author talking about wood ship in agricultural gardens and orchards

and other settings in order to help rebalance the fungal to bacterial ratios in the soil ecosystems

similarly the the broad scale use of pesticides has severely disrupted underground we’ve got the

pollinators and invertebrates above ground and then we’ve got this other set of ecosystem members

below ground where we’ve essentially been systematically destroying the fungal species and

have seen an increase in the bacterial species bringing the soil ecosystems out of balance as well

and so this is an above and below kind of a two-pronged situation it’s so important that we’re

addressing right and i’m curious if you’re doing any work with soil related regeneration at this

point with your portfolios. Yeah actually one of our fun two companies is called myrotera and they

basically have created the you know the most accurate way of being able to go measure the compounds

that are in soil and the technology is such that you could do the stuff infield you could you know

measure everything and change your your treatment plan if you’re a farmer within the same day

as opposed to right now you would typically need to go around and take a bunch of soil samples a

bunch of soil cores send them to a soil testing lab wait for weeks or months by the time the stuff

gets back it’s like other management practices has happened in between you’ve applied fertilizer you’ve

applied you know herbicide you’ve applied different things that might actually change that profile

so we’ve never been able to just like understand where the soil is right now and then be able to

make smart management choices and because of that you know it’s estimated that the application of the

the most common inputs into agriculture are massively over applied right now and this is you know

NPK’s nitrogen phosphorus potassium is kind of like the the classic like super trio and then

depending on what you’re growing then there will be different you know micronutrients and

others that you will track because it’s important for that crop type but NPK is pretty common across

the board so something like this will would allow you to kind of go into the field understand NPK

literally right there and be able to go you know adjust how you were applying things in the field

immediately and and by our estimates it could move into the territory of doubling farm incomes

just given the nature of the current margins and the percentage of the cost structure that

currently goes to over application and the over application helps nobody right if you put extra

nitrogen on the field you’re like oh maybe it stays fertile for the next year no it doesn’t

basically becomes nitrous oxide emissions which is basically the third most you know prevalent greenhouse

gas that we are producing at scale after carbon dioxide and methane so it helps nobody the farmer

wasted money that could have been money in their pocket you know the the environment is further hurt

the soil is not improved in any way from it so to be able to go fix this fix multiple problems

including the kind of runoff that leads to eutrification downstream

yeah now there is one other one other like benefit and tweak to this is in the process of being

able to like grab NPK the same instrument doesn’t just get three things it can actually you know

assess everything that it’s trained for so we could train the thing to actually pick up hundreds

of interesting compounds including all this micronutrients but notably be able to go measure soil

carbon directly and there’s a lot of people that are out there say well if I fly this satellite

and we’re used synthetic aperture radar and we interpolate the points right then one can presume

that the soil carbon levels bubble block and I would just tell you that it’s really hard to pull that

off you’re just very far away from the thing you’re trying to measure and a farmer walking their

field just kind of pointing this instrument a number of things you can get insanely more accurate

and if you wanted to be able to enroll farmers into you know the larger system of carbon markets

that it’s helpful to be able to just get very accurate measurements close up now besides the fact

that’s um you know it’s been hard to measure in the past the other reason that carbon markets

haven’t been that interesting to farmers is you know your land might sequester you know one to three

tons per year per acre right we just kind of put it in a reasonable range look it can do less than

that for sure you know but certainly farmers have been able to get into that range and if that’s

the case if you look at the voluntary carbon markets right now maybe you’re going to net yourself

eight dollars ten dollars twelve dollars you know at the end of the year on an acre that might

top line a thousand dollars so you can understand why people don’t completely change their

management approaches to get eight more dollars on a thousand now look their margins are way worse

than that maybe they’re take home from the thousand dollars is only sixty dollars but even then

it’s like do you change the management practice for everything and put yourself in kind of this

unknown space in order to try to nudge things up by eight dollars it’s not it’s not that you know

compelling to most farmers but if you actually have an instrument where they’re going out there

measuring NPK which is what they want to do anyway because you might save a hundred dollars on

on fertilizer and inputs for hundred fifty dollars and you get this very material to your to your

net profitability then then in the process of doing that you actually automatically got the

carbon measurement then it just becomes a bonus on top of something that you were going to do anyway

and the one last thing I’ll say about this tech which I think is very very compelling is that

unlike you know neutron backscatter or a bunch of these you know other kind of near and for

red spectroscopy approaches which have a bunch of different limitations not only will we be able

to go and and measure that carbon directly we will be able to go tell the difference between

you know short labile carbon long labile carbon and mineralized carbon and in these markets people

have a at a huge price premium for things that are kind of mineralized because we know that to

stay in the in the soils in a pretty stable state for thousands of years sometimes tens of thousands

of years right and then labile carbon short labile carbon might be in an organism and then back

out in the atmosphere in five days you know long labile might be in there for you know five years

ten years you know hundred years but you know it will come back out in a bit but to be able to

understand the relative proportions and kind of teach farmers from that direct measurement

to be able to to manage things in a way that massively improve their profitability but also

kind of creates that on ramp for a relationship to carbon markets it’s it’s very exciting on a bunch

of fronts we we could not be more excited about the kind of forward potential of that type of tech

getting into the world. It’s so wonderful so that’s Mira Tara and just for some of our audience that

may not know the term eutrophication thisis aof tech getting into the world.

It’s so wonderful.

So that’s Mira Terra.

And just for some of our audience,

it may not know the term beautification.

This is essentially when we overload

in water environments, the nutrient density,

we lead to essentially oxygen-starved situations

leading to major dead zones in many of our river

deltas worldwide.

And so this is a really significant issue

where our major river systems meet the oceans of the world.

And I didn’t catch that.

The highest form of water pollution

in the world by volume.

And it has very substantial ecological effects.

Yeah, yeah.

I didn’t catch the name of the honeybee vaccine company

if you mentioned it and want to share it.

That’s called Delan Animal Health, E-A-L-A-N.

I want to be sure to share with our audience also, Tom,

this wonderful talk that you gave

at one of your annual general meetings

and shared with me and with our YonEarth community state

of the planet talk.

And we’re going to make this available in the show notes

and probably through the YonEarth community blog

page for folks to check it out themselves.

In this talk, you mentioned several really interesting things

about emerging technologies, about some of the trends

that you’re tracking.

And one of the things specifically that struck me

was your characterization of these four different epochs

in our economic development, our technology development,

as it relates to things like ecosystem, stewardship,

regeneration, climate stabilization,

and so on, which, in the way you characterize these,

it begins with epoch zero.

Can you walk us through this framework

and tell us a bit about this?

Yeah, so I’m glad you’ll be able to kind of post it

for folks to see the full talk, because full talk’s like an hour.

So there’s no way that I’d be able to fit it

in like a five minute answer or whatever.

But it’s called the three epochs of ecological technology.

Because there’s three where you’re actually trying

to get better relative to the relationship

of economy to ecology.

And then the zero one is the one we’re in right now,

which is the fully extractive economy.

So epoch zero is the extractive economy.

And the gist of the extractive economy

is that natural resources are understood to be commodities.

People achieve financial leverage

by basically scaling extraction.

So if you can, if the same equipment

can cut down twice as many trees in a day, then boom,

that’s scale, guys, that’s how we get leverage.

And then economic indicators in that kind of framework,

which is remember the framework of today,

tend to either be uncoupled,

but often more often antithetical to ecological goals.

So like on one hand, you might look at that

and you say like, yeah, yeah, okay, sure,

the same machine where like version 2.0 of that machine

can cut down twice as many trees per day.

Yeah, I would make a lot more money like that.

It’s a big economic win.

But you can see how that’s like directly against

the ecological health indicators.

So effectively, like in this current epoch,

to run an economy, we cannot help,

but destroy the ecology.

Now, if you think about where we could be going instead of that,

because it’s like, well, you know,

what are we even talking about?

You’re just describing the world of days.

Is there any other thing you could do?

Then the epoch beyond that is called

the material productivity economy.

And the gist of material productivity,

is it as a slightly different question?

It asks, you know, well, first it recognizes that,

you know, instead of resources just being commodities,

that resources, you know, natural resources

are still commodities in this framework,

but with practical natural limits.

And we actually see a bunch of economic frameworks,

whether it’s donut economics or whether it’s, you know,

that were like the different kind of analyses of like,

oh, we’re using three and a half earths of this resource,

that kind of thing, that are basically trying to talk

about the commodities with practical limits kind of thing.

So all of that thinking fits in a material productivity epoch,

which by the way, there’s still two more epochs beyond that.

So, you know, but that said,

this is the epoch, which is closest to us.

And because of it, it’s the one that we can most practically

work on today.

But getting to it, if you understand

that commodities have practical limits,

then what it means to get better

in a material productivity economy

is you ask yourself the question,

well, how do I get more financial leverage

by more judicious and effective use

of the same amount of material or the same amount of energy?

So for example, like if I go and take a handful of sand,

a handful of sand could be sold to the construction market

for literally pennies, right?

Fraction of a penny for a handful of sand.

But the same amount of mass and a handful of sand

could be used to go make a hundred microchips.

And that might, you know, that might get you back

like $5,000 worth of the top line revenue

compared to, you know, if you’re selling it to like a

through a sand and gravel situation

to construction, it might be one penny.

Now, that was the same amount of physical material.

We had to do different things to it,

but like we got more material productivity out of it.

That’s why it’s called the material productivity up up.

And the same sort of question around materials

can be asked around energy.

So for each, you know, kilowatt or jewel or BTU,

you pick your favorite, you know, unit of energy,

then how do we get the most benefit?

Whether it’s economic benefit, social benefit,

ecological benefit, that’s the question

that the material productivity epoch asks of us.

Now, like I said, this is the one that’s closest to us.

And most of the folks that talk about sustainability

are talking about different variations of this epoch.

But, you know, in our work and if people spend time

with the talk, then you will hear

that there’s a couple epochs beyond this.

So, so, and the next epoch is kind of the first really big jump.

So, epoch two, because everything until now is like,

look, natural resources are commodities.

We just got to be smarter with it.

You know, we need to have an outer ring to the donut.

We need to have an inner ring to the donut.

Hey, right, like we just got to be smarter

about some of these things.

But, epoch two is the first big jump.

And this is basically instead of understanding

natural resources as commodities,

what if we understood, you know, the actual resource

is healthy ecosystem metabolic.

So, not nouns, not the nouns of tonnage of wood extracted,

lumber extracted, not the nouns of, you know,

like tonnage of like mind or extracted,

which is the way that we think about economic growth

right now and resources right now.

But like thinking in turn, which are also nouns, right,

those are basically just like this is a thing

that I can sell you, it’s a noun.

If instead you have the big shift of starting to think

about ecosystem metabolic,

you start to understand the resources of the verb.

The watershed is a verb or a watershed to be healthy

actually creates an enormous amount of economic value.

Now, we find out that it’s a lot,

enormous amount of economic value when we mess it up, right?

When we dam it or we mess up the poison, the ground water

or like, you know, put a bunch of fertilizer in there

so it’s eutrophied and so on and so forth, right?

Like we find out later that oh my gosh,

this was actually the resource.

Now what is a watershed?

A watershed is not a noun,

but I can like pick up and sell you,

like I can sell you like a couple tons of timber

or where I can sell you a couple, you know,

tons of the specific extracted ore

or even like a service, right?

Like a watershed is effectively only healthy

if the verb is going right.

And you need to like get out of that mindset of like,

well, what even happens on a market exchange?

A market exchange is basically selling nouns.

So this stock is a noun and it represents a company

that does this type of extraction

and that’s a bunch of nouns and if you get out

of that entire thinking,

if you get out of that line of thinking entirely

and you start to understand we are only here

because of a series of healthy, you know,

ecological metabolic verbs.

And to the extent that we start to treat those verbs

as actually the core of where economic, you know,

wealth comes from,

then we will start treating the whole thing quite differently.

Now there’s been a bunch of like, you know,

partial stabs at this.

So for example, valuing nature-based services

is an example of that.

But in a way that’s kind of taking the verb

and trying to move it back into a noun frame

and be like see, like it’s worth this

as opposed to the ore that you would have got,

it was worth that, right?

But the problem with that frame

is you’re not valuing the metabolic directly.

And because you’re not valuing it directly,

we might discover a new type of ore

that is just more valuable than the ecosystem service.

And also it all explodes.

So like I’m not saying that people should not do that type of work.

I’m just saying that it has programmed in it

a type of fragility because the foundational thought process

is still trading nouns in a market

as opposed to the verbs are the source of all economic value

and in a way they are sacred.

And actually the question of sacredness

is a pretty deep one on this,

where it is often said,

we live in this market economy, blah, blah, blah, blah.

And I know we’re going to talk a bit

and we can talk about that next, actually,

after I talk about the epics about,

economy economics is the design discipline

as opposed to a science.

But right now we live in this kind of market economy

or we all kind of believe it in enough

that’s the current way that economics is designed.

And because of it, everything has a price,

which means even the damage in the world,

if you could make enough money at it,

you will feel free to do it.

But I will put out there that we actually do have a type

of economic classification that’s outside of that.

We haven’t used it very often,

but it’s really important that we get more familiar with it.

And for lack of better term,

I call it kind of like the sacred fraction of things, right?

And for example, there are international laws

against selling organs, right?

Because even though organs would have a market price

and a person could live without a kid, right?

It’s possible, a lot of people do.

Then it would be a very dangerous world

if you basically just had a price for all of that

and people might use that to go exploit the poor

and be like, well, you know, you only make $10 a day

and your kidney would be worth this much, right?

Like you start to get into pretty gruesome things

if you don’t have a fraction of the world

that is just considered to be sacred.

And I think everybody understands this.

Like if you had just had your first kid

and you’re like, you know, walking down the street

and the kids in the stroller, whatever,

and they’re six months old or something,

if somebody walked by and said, how much?

You’d be like, no, this is not for sale.

I know we live in a market economy,

this is just off the table.

We’re not even a little bit okay with that.

So like clearly every human mind understands this category.

We pretend not to understand this category

when we participate in a market economy.

But I think we actually need to put some more things

in this category, including the sacredness

of ecosystem metabolic as the source

of all value creation in the economy.

And this is why I say Epic II is actually a pretty big shift.

Now, if you get that done,

then where you get financial leverage

is not from the machine that can extract stuff

twice as fast.

The place where you get financial leverage is

that a little bit of care in protecting

or enriching the ecosystem metabolic

leads to massively healthier ecosystem metabolic,

which creates way more wealth

than the tiny bit of care that you put into that.

And you think about all the folks

that spend time on regenerative landscaping

and agriculture, right?

They’ll spend a little bit of time

with some earth moving in order to set up some scales

like in order to go change the moisture transport

about the landscape.

And because of it, they are encouraging

healthier ecosystem metabolic.

Well, that one time upfront cost

could lead to major economic benefit

year after year after year.

And actually the more that you make those verbs healthier,

then the more, it actually,

unlike most mechanical things

that where the maintenance cost gets higher over time,

in this case, as the ecosystem gets healthier,

the maintenance cost gets lower over time.

So like the net productivity is higher,

the maintenance cost is lower and lower.

And in the crudest terms,

you can call this a form of financial leverage.

Because at the end of the day,

then a bunch of money people are going to need

to understand this.

And they like to go here words like financial leverage.

And this is absolutely mappable

into that framework.

But you need to first understand

that the basic metabolic is sacred.

And then once you get into that,

then you can start saying like,

okay, well, what is most honoring of the sacred metabolic?

And what is the ways that we can work with,

manage, be in concert with these metabolic

so that it gets way healthier,

because we’re around, as opposed to,

oh, well, we cut down this forest,

but the land can still take it.
