Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today we’re visiting with Vicki Hird, the author of re-bugging the planet. Hi Vicki.

Hi, good to be here. It’s great to visit with you and what we’re going to be talking about today is obviously one of the most important topics for our entire global community and planetary situation. So I’m really, really excited we have this opportunity to visit with you.

It’s great to be here. I have been so pleased with the reactions to the reports and people’s interest in it. So it’s great to be speaking about it.

Wonderful. And I think for fun, we’ll maybe refer to this episode as our creepy crawly episode.

As long as you don’t put noses in there because they’re not nasty.

Not at all. No, we’d love it. Maybe we love it creepy code. Yes.

Vicki herd is head of the sustainable farming campaign for sustain the alliance for better food and farming. And she also runs an independent consultancy and experienced an award-winning environmental campaigner researcher writer and strategist working mainly in the food farming and environmental policy arenas.

Vicki has worked on government policy for many years and is also the author of perfectly safe to eat the facts on food.

Vicki’s passion is insects. The first pets she gave her children were a family of stick insects and she had a giraffe necked weevil tattoo for her 50th birthday.

Vicki also has a master’s degree in pest management and she is a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and Vicki as you and I were just discussing before we began to record.

Today is your first day. Congratulations on a new job as a strategic leader on agriculture at the wildlife trust. So that’s wonderful. Congratulations.

Thank you. Yeah. Been a busy busy day, but it’s good to be there.

I’m so sure and yeah, thanks for taking the time on day one to visit with us and really excited to dive into this and and to kick things off.

I’m just going to ask you a very open question. Like why why bugs? Why does it matter? What are we talking about?

Well, I think there’s such a critical part of our ecosystem, part of our lives. And one of the reasons I wrote the book was because I don’t think enough people recognize that or realize that.

Although I think that’s changing. One of the reasons also that I wrote the book because I think people are beginning to be interested.

There’s been a lot more wildlife programs that cover invertebrates. There’s been books. There’s been like citizen science where people get involved.

And I think we need to tap into that and understand what it means for people in terms of their lives, their politics, their consumption.

So I wrote the book with that in mind, but also with the idea of making bugs their role and their brilliance and their beauty a bit clearer.

So as a paperback, it’s not, you know, it’s not a huge tone with loads of pictures, but there’s a lot out there on the invertebrates.

But I just wanted to sort of distill it in one book with loads and loads of tips for what you can do as well, which was key for me at the campaigner.

I always want to communicate what you can do. But they’re also in trouble. That’s the other reason.

Absolutely. Yeah. And we’ll be talking about that. And just, you know, those of our audience who are watching the video version of our discussion.

This is a copy of the book. This is actually a galley advanced copy.

And yeah, the cover is so beautiful with all of this.

It is nice, isn’t it? Yeah. The diversity there. And it’s not just insects. That’s the important thing. Insects are critical.

But all the other invertebrates, the species without a spine in our rivers, in our seas, on our land, in our soil.

They’re everywhere, almost everywhere. And they’re really critical. And combining them with the fungi, we certainly won’t be here without them.

Absolutely. Can you give us the bad news? Where are we in terms of what’s happening with the invertebrates right now?

Yeah. There’s some really scary long-term trend studies, which shows over decades how the number of species and diversity of species has been declining.

Where they’ve been actually looking. And that’s not everywhere. So there’s a big gap in the data, a big gap in the research, which I think scientists globally are beginning to fill.

You know, in the last five years, there’s been a massive scientific recognition of the problem. So they’re starting to look how we can fill that.

It’s probably enough just within the side. You know, one of the things we’ve been researching on invertebrates for the past 200 years is how to kill them.

How to get rid of them? How to zap them? And now, you know, there’s a lot more money and research going into how to protect them, how to avoid destroying their habitats and their lives.

So that’s really exciting. But it doesn’t mean there’s gaps. But what we’ve seen is the combination of factors. There isn’t one single thing.

But we know that several different factors have been creating this big long-term decline in many species and many critical species.

But also species that we love, you know, butterflies and mayflies and all sorts that we actually love because of how beautiful they are.

But also they feed other things that we think are beautiful like birds. And obviously they have critical functions in our food system.

But climate change, habitat loss, losing their habitat. And I’d have it being fragmented, which means they’re really isolated.

They’re doing well in one patch, but they can’t get to the next patch to mate, to recolonize, to feed, to have a refuge.

They haven’t got that corridor. Those fragmentation are really, really problematic, particularly in farmed land and land, which has been heavily degraded through usually farming.

But other reasons as well, like mining and development and encroachment from cities and towns.

So those two are biggies, but also pollution. Pollution coming from pesticides, fertilizers, manure, particularly in river and marine environments, which have so many invertebrates in them, critical invertebrates.

And so that pollution, but it’s also things like plastic pollution and noise pollution.

And so these biggies, you know, climate change is a critical one because they’re such small animals.

Their surface to volume ratio is very high, so they can lose heat and lose walks very quickly.

So they can be particularly badly impacted when you’ve got extremes that they weren’t predicting.

At the same time, insects and invertebrates can adapt. They’re known as radar tool.

They produce millions of offspring every year, many of them. So they can adapt.

But if we change it so fast, as we are with the climate change, and have attack loss and pollution incidents, then it’s very difficult for them.

And they just crash. They don’t thrive and they don’t move around as they should.

And so that’s one of the things that we can all do something about, having gardens, having green spaces.

Yeah, absolutely. You know, and as as you and I previously discussed, we had a Scott Zershi on the podcast series,

the executive director of the Earth, excuse me, Scott Black, the director of the Zershi society.

And in that discussion, we were talking about the what looks like potentially the sixth great extinction.

Yeah, very scary, very scary.

I’ve heard some pretty staggering figures around biodiversity and biomass reductions.

And he mentioned in Germany, a study showing something like 75% decrease in flying insect biomass.

That was a big one. Yeah, that was one that triggered a lot of media interest. Yeah, it was scary.

What’s your what’s your read? What’s your take on where we’re at worldwide in terms of some of these percent changes?

Well, they are beginning to sort of do collective analyses of all the studies and suggestions that 40% are at risk of going extinct.

And some of these will be ones that we haven’t even discovered yet.

You know, there’s invertebrates even around us that we haven’t discovered yet in these soils.

But in places in the global south in South America, there’s millions probably that we don’t know about.

So it’s hard to say, but there are 40% has drawn from a lot of studies that we’re potentially seeing massive extensions.

And then there’s the sort of problem that you get when you get sort of extensional crashes locally.

I mean, locally it could be in a nation or in a region.

And, you know, we talk about foods and, you know, we love foods. It is chocolates and coffee.

They rely on a very tiny fly to be pollinated.

And if you lose that fly for other reasons, for deforestation, for pollution, mining elsewhere,

you’re not going to get the chocolate and you’re not going to get the coffee.

So it’s things like that.

And it is quite scary when you look at the figures about deforestation and removal of wetlands, critical wetlands in places.

And we’ve done a lot of damage already in, I live in the UK, in North America.

You’ve got a lot of clearance already, but you do have your wilderness areas, which are amazing.

Refuges and all wilderness areas are much smaller.

But we’re trying, but there are some really serious alarm bells ringing that we’ve got to all act on.

Yeah, absolutely. Well, wait a minute.

So it’s one species of fly that pollens chocolate worldwide.

It’s a tiny, tiny fly.

I think there’s probably different species worldwide that have learned how to do it.

But from where chocolate originally came from, which I think might be Asia, but I might be wrong about that.

But yeah, it’s tiny.

And so, you know, you can’t have another kind of species doing it, because they’ll be too big,

or their wings will be too long, or they won’t have the right mouth parts.

You know, these evolution of relationships between bugs and plants have been over millennia.

And you know, you can’t recreate them that easily.

However, adaptable invertebrates are.

But what we’re trying to do, in some plots of the world, where they’ve lost their pollinators, like in China,

they’re actually doing hand pollination.

And they’re developing robotic bees.

I talk about that in the book, actually.

I think it’s hilarious.

You know, the millions that will be spent, and the resources, like metals, that will be used in creating robotic bees.

When we’ve got something on tap that is free, replicates itself, does the best job,

and gets right to the heart of the flower.

You know, we should be protecting the bees, and the other pollinators,

absolutely without fail, rather than investing billions in robotic bees.

Or spending millions in hand pollination.

Is suitable in some circumstances, when you want to do things differently.

But it’s not a solution to world hunger without pollinators.

Oh, my gosh.

You know, this reminds me of an episode we recently did with Tom Chi,

who has a company called At One Ventures.

And he’s tracking all kinds of emerging regenerative technologies.

And he was talking about, in the energy industry,

there was a multi-billion-dollar carbon sequestration plant that was funded by one of the big oil and gas companies

that sequestered or has the potential to sequester the same amount of carbon

as something like approximately 137 beavers.

Beavers, right? Animals that do their things are free.

And we don’t have depreciation.

We don’t have machinery that’s wearing out over time.

And so…

A lot of cement probably involved in that.

Lots of cement, which is unbelievably bad for climate.

So, yeah, if and as we’re getting more intelligent and harmonized

with the natural brilliance genius of all these different species and their roles,

I think they’re going to do so much more in the way of restoration and regeneration

than probably, you know, many more technology.

Lots of say we shouldn’t do anything.

Absolutely.

Yeah. But there is actually billion spent on that,

which could be used to really reinforce the existing systems,

the natural systems that can do it so well, like forests and woods and beavers,

as you say, they’re amazing keystone species.

But so wood ants, you know, making sure the wood ants can survive.

They provide an environment in woods, for instance, up in Scotland,

which provide a really balanced environment of pest predators and pathogens

and herbivores, making sure that the forest survives well.

When you take them out, the forest declines and you get over abundance of pest species.

So those keystone species exist in the invertebrate world,

as well as the mammalian.

Yeah. I mean, carbon capture and storage, which is possibly what was being referred to there,

the carbon. You know, it’s still untried.

It’s still untested at scale.

And they’re pouring millions into it, subsidies.

Our taxpayers’ money is going into that.

So it’s really, it strikes me as interesting what you mentioned about the wild open spaces

here in the United States versus the smaller versions in the UK.

I’m curious from a land use perspective,

what would your policy recommendations be in a place like the UK given?

Yeah. Yeah.

How do patterns have already been deployed?

Well, we’ve got a very dense population in the UK.

You know, we haven’t got as much land as you have to have wilderness areas

that are genuinely left to rewild themselves and maintain themselves

to a strong degree.

But what we’ve done with our natural spaces,

and our natural parks, our parks that are supposed to be protected,

is not particularly well.

I mean, seriously not.

And you use them in ways which many think are deeply unsustainable

and certainly don’t retain a nature and wildlife that we need to provide that refuge for those species.

So there’s a lot of campaigns to reinforce the rewilding approach to natural environmental, natural areas.

And then there’s a whole spectrum.

Like if you’re going to farm in those natural parks and nature parks,

which we tend to have to because we’ve got a very large population that needs feeding

and we don’t want to throw food from elsewhere too much,

to do it in ways which protect nature.

And you can do that.

You can do nature-based farming with a lot of really great habitat for,

and rotations in the farm system,

which can actually retain a really good population, diverse population of invertebrates,

which will also help you when you farm, you know,

like that pest predators, you know,

they’re brilliant at doing what they do in a farm situation.

But actually introducing that into systems which have been farming cheap for a long time,

or intensive cereals, et cetera,

it takes a lot to change the culture and the habits,

and also the supply chains and the buyers.

So it’s a complex picture we weave if we’re going to try and do more wilderness areas in the UK.

There’s a lot of opposition, there’s a lot of pressure.

It’s a bit of a hot topic here in the UK.

But that’s why I mentioned it.

You’ve had your wilderness for many years created by politicians and maintained,

which we can be envious of,

but we don’t necessarily have the opportunity to completely recreate.

Perhaps a shout out to Teddy Roosevelt.

Absolutely, yeah, he’s a bit of a call.

But we have, you know, we have done things here.

We have green belts, we have natural parks,

but they are under a huge amount of pressure.

Amazing.

Well, I want to be sure that we’re talking about the invertebrates in soil and water,

but before going there, the flying ones,

the ones perhaps many of us might think of more immediately.

You know, I drive through the Midwest,

so regularity.

And I’ve really noticed these past few years that we get far fewer bugs on the windshield

than we did last driving there as a kid.

And around here, lately in Colorado,

I’ve been actually thrilled to see more bugs on the windshield

as perhaps morbid as that might sound or counterintuitive as that might sound.

What it essentially implies is that the populations are stronger, right?

Stronger, absolutely.

You know, it’s funny.

That was the subtitle of the book originally.

When I recently put it to Chelsea Green,

it was so great in accepting it.

They said, maybe the young people won’t know what you’re talking about when you say

and how to get the bugs back on your windshield,

because we haven’t had them for so long in the UK.

Unless you’re in an amazing organic farm or one of the good parks,

it’s very rare to get bugs on your windshield.

But funny enough, we have a bug life,

which is a conservation organisation for invertebrates.

They do a splatter campaign every year,

and they get people to print out a splatter test

for their cars.

And then you drive for a while,

and then you send it in the results.

And it’s citizen science with the splatter test.

But I think, you know, that’s an indicator if you’re getting more in Colorado.

That’s really great.

But I think the intensification of our farming systems,

the neatness of it, the chemicals,

the reduction in edges and woodlands,

all massive factors in that, you know,

the invertebrates just have got a chance.

Wow, I love hearing about the citizen science work.

We did something here for organizations,

and the city of Boulder,

with different organics, soil amendments,

and people who are testing for carbon sequestration

and wildlife.

Oh, great.

Really a lot of fun to participate in that.

That’s cool to hear about.

We’re actually starting to talk here about people getting money off their water bills

if they have soil in their gardens,

because people are starting to, you know,

too much concrete or tiling or even worse,

plastic grass.

You know, they’re terrible in all sorts of ways,

but they really don’t absorb the water.

So you get, you know, potential flooding and things like that.

So it’s an interesting fiscal measures

that could help drive people towards that.

And more carbon, knowing that they’ve got more carbon,

we’re exciting people, I would have thought.

So that’s really clever of Boulder.

Oh, that’s amazing.

How far along is that after that?

Not very far as far as I know.

I saw a headline.

I thought I was very excited about it.

We need to push it.

We need to push those things.

You know, getting those nudge things

that can help people make decisions differently.

Although I think we should ban plastic lawns.

Sorry, that’s it.

I don’t know if we’ll get that,

but you know, there’s all sorts of things people can do.

Even if they’ve got concrete,

they can put pots, do a lot.

You know, if they can’t get rid of the concrete,

they can do an awful lot for the bugs.

Absolutely.

What are some of the techniques

if folks have a lot of concrete they’re dealing with?

Yeah, well, we’ve got actually Chelsea Green

who published a brilliant book by a guy

and I’ve forgotten his name right now,

but I can share it with you.

He’s done that balcony gardener

or something like that.

He’s got brilliant ways of producing amazing abundance

in pots, in planters,

and even on a balcony you can produce a lot of food

and a lot of flowers for the pollinators.

And that book’s got loads of ideas

and there’s a lot on the internet as well

about how you can raise a lot of plants

in diversity and diversity is key to protecting the bugs.

So if you have a garden with mostly concrete,

you can put a huge amount of plantas,

you know, raised beds with soil,

so you get the soil bugs as well,

and healthy soil gives you healthy food.

But even if you can’t be raised beds,

you can do a lot of pots.

You know, if you’ve got a small yard,

you could have 50 pots all producing different things

and flowers at different times a year.

And having that year-round flowering

could be really important for the invertebrates

in terms of a refuge, food source,

nest thing, areas.

So there’s a lot you can,

everybody can do something.

Yeah, absolutely.

I’ll do something.

I love this.

And I’m starting to envision slogan,

save the chocolate fly.

Yes, yes.

Plant it, plant it.

Plant something in a garden, save the chocolate fly.

Well, that might be more to do with what you,

you know, what you buy,

so your lifestyle,

because that’s as critical as what you do in your area.

So how you purchase chocolate,

you know, go for organic and fed trade,

and shop around, shop around,

and find out what they’re doing

to actually reduce chemical use,

because there are chemicals used in these systems.

And chocolate and coffee can be grown

in really great agroforestry systems,

because they’re shade plants.

So it’s really great if they mix forestry systems

producing coffee, cocoa,

and fruits,

and that could be really beneficial

for the communities producing it as well.

Mixed outcomes,

feeding your local communities as well.

So I’ll ask you questions of your shopkeepers

and your retailers.

Love it.

Yeah, you know, Vicki Maya,

my permaculture teacher,

the late Scott Pittman,

give him a big shout out,

he fits in consulting work

for the Mars company decades ago.

At the time, they were monocroping their cacao

and experiencing all kinds of issues.

It doesn’t work.

Monocrops eventually don’t work, I think.

Yeah, he basically went in

and recommended multi-story…

Yeah, exactly.

3D growing, yeah.

Brilliant.

It’s really good.

So chocolate coffee,

and I’ll just give a quick shout out.

We’ve done episodes with Dr. Bronner’s

and with Equal Exchange,

their co-op with chocolate and coffee offerings

that we can all select.

And of course,

recognizing the power of our consumer demand,

in addition to our engagement with governance

and policy and all of the things

we can do in our own yards and neighborhoods

and gardens that really forms this,

I think, trifecta.

And I know, Vicki,

you speak to this a lot in terms of calls to action

and maybe we’ll repeat this at the end of the episode.

It looks with it, but I was struck

when we were chatting earlier

about your way of framing

what people can do about these issues.

It’s a bit overwhelming, isn’t it?

The global crisis,

and right now we’ve got unbelievable climate extremes going on.

And that’s going to accelerate.

So people might get a bit overwhelmed,

but I said to people,

have a bit of a plan.

If you have got,

you understand the role of invertebrates

in our environment.

They are absolutely critical

for our pollination,

for our soils,

for our water systems.

They do amazing filtration.

But most importantly,

they provide nutrients for the food that we grow.

Anyway, loads of ways in which they’re critical.

And also for our clothes,

and the wooden chairs we’re sitting on,

we wouldn’t have any of that.

So if you care about that,

have a little plan.

And the plan can be,

like what you’re doing in your house,

or your garden,

or your local park,

or even just the verge,

outside your block of flats,

or if there’s a space

that you can actually start to talk to people

about doing something on.

So that’s,

have a plan for doing something in your area,

or your garden,

or your house,

even protecting the spiders,

which are really great fly control as well.

So I have something for your place.

Something about your life cells.

So we talked about, you know,

going fair trade, organic,

start to ask questions,

start to explore,

where you can buy directly from the farmer,

because then they’ll get more reward

for what they’re doing.

So they’ll be able to do it better.

They can transition to what we call

agro-ecological farming,

which is like organic.

And if they get such a tiny percentage,

that they usually get from a very complex supply chain,

and then retailers

who are incredibly cutthroat at the other end,

and all competing with each other

to get people into the doors.

So it’s very complex and costly chain.

So farmers often get very little.

So if you can buy direct,

or go through something called a better free trader,

then you are making a big difference.

But it’s not just food as well.

It’s also about what food you buy.

You think, you know,

things like everything from the land

has an impact on invertebrates.

So when things are very, very impactful on the land,

for instance,

livestock products,

palm oil,

oil seeds,

they’re all coming from either very intensive systems,

which require a lot of feed into the livestock,

or produced using deforestation

or destruction of really important weapons.

So thinking about what you buy as well.

And there’s loads of tips and ideas.

This isn’t a,

you must kind of think,

it’s just think about what you buy,

how it’s infected the land.

And so I give a lot of tips in the book.

But think about eating less and better meat,

fresh where you can.

Junk food is really bad for the environment and the bugs.

So that’s the second thing.

And then I would say,

what you’re wearing,

and you’re, you know,

you’re clothes,

what you purchase,

all that’s important to you.

Because a lot of that comes from the land.

And then the final thing,

so that’s the second thing,

your lifestyle.

And then the third thing,

is your politics,

you as a citizen,

how you can influence your local politicians

in how they manage the parks,

or how they help people to choose differently.

And then nationally,

you know,

to national estate or national level,

how you can work with organizations,

writing letters to members of parliament or representatives.

And being the voice for the bugs,

and you can be a voice,

if you join together,

you can be a powerful movement.

And in the book,

there’s loads of organizations you can join.

And international ones,

as well as local ones.

And joining together can be very powerful thing

to counter the might of some very powerful organizations,

corporations that want the status quo,

you know,

want to be able to continue to use chemicals

that we know are harmful,

or continue to drive production in a way which we know

is the wrong direction for protecting our soils

and protecting our invertebrates.

I’ll leave it there,

but those three things have a little plan

how you can be a citizen,

be a lifestyle,

change,

and what your place is.

Thank you.

It’s so wonderful and inspiring.

You know, we’re actually,

maybe I’ll pick this up

in our behind-the-scenes piece that will record

after the main podcast interview,

but we’re working on a resource for neighborhoods

and homeowners associations to…

Ah, brilliant.

…and rules to affect this kind of systemic change
