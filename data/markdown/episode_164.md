## Transcript

Hey friends, it’s Aaron here and we just finished recording a podcast with Kate Wilson,

the Vice President of Environmental and Social Responsibility at Vale Resorts and Kate, what

a pleasure to be able to talk with you about so many amazing and highly impactful things

you and your team are doing at Vale Resorts and thanks for taking this additional time

to join our behind-the-scenes segment for our Ambassador Network.

Of course, I’m happy to do it.

We covered so much and honestly I’m like kind of full, feeling really like full and joyful

about all of the themes and threads that we wove together in the tapestry of our conversation

and so I’m also excited about what we’re now going to chat about because I know there’s

going to be a couple of really funny and sort of a-ha things in this part.

And let me maybe kick it off by asking, so this work you’re doing, was there something

you experienced earlier in life or in your childhood that sort of set you on this path?

Yeah, I grew up in a family where on the weekends we would always go hiking or somewhere

to be outside in the woods, grew up going to the Iterondex, which is a super special

place for me and so being on water and just being out in nature and kind of the magic

that comes with that and having family time or friend time outside has always been sort

of part of how it was brought up.

I think it really clicked for me in terms of a career when junior year I studied abroad

in Kenya and Tanzania.

It was the time 9-11 happened but before that I was an anthropology major and I thought

I wanted to study sort of the human aspect of languages and all of that but when I went

to Kenya and Tanzania what I realized after seeing sort of destruction that Westernization

was sort of putting out there, some of the waste, some of the way that the overconsumption,

sort of some of these things, I was like, we may be spreading this part unintentionally

and I thought I’m still interested in this issue but from a different perspective.

I want to, this is where I want to make the biggest impact on climate change I can

think came from and I never looked back so it came from that moment of like, okay actually

I want to do this work, like I need to do this work so that’s where it came from and

watching, yeah, cultures and I got to live with them aside for a minute and I got to

go to the Encore-encore creator and it just was incredible, like went a little bit of Swahili

and then 9-11 happened and I came home but it really struck with me of like, okay actually

I want to do this differently so I was an anthropology major and now I just missed a semester because

of 9-11 and had to come up with, you know, I had to switch my major pretty quickly so

I went to Colorado College for the summer and I did three lab courses which were with

backpacked and kayaked, the Colorado River for headwaters to mouth so from Wyoming to

Mexico and met with, you know, the Bureau, we met with native groups, we met with tribes,

we met with all sorts of folks the whole way down and learned about the health of the

Colorado River and how the, you know, water rights were set and all these different things

and how agriculture impacted it on the way to California and it was like totally amazing

for me so I needed to catch up in lab science because I hadn’t been doing that so this

was a way that that counted and solidified for me, like yeah, this is the place I want

to be, I want to be the voice for, yeah, both sort of the people and the way that we approach

that in the equitable manner as well as protecting these amazing places so that’s how we got

Absolutely amazing, incredible, wow, that river trip must have been just amazing and we

talked about, you know, experiential learning, right, we were looking under a rock finding

what was hatching, tying our own flies to then catch fish, like it was, it was amazing

and then I, you know, I wasn’t sure after that, I think it took me a minute to kind of

figure out where in this space I wanted to be so I was a grassroots organizer in the

beginning of my career with Green Court.

I was a climate lobbyist in DC, I worked in a renewable space and that was a consultant

for 10 years, right, and then now I’m in house so I kind of looked at this challenge from

many different angles which I think helps when we’re meeting with community members

or we’re thinking about lobbying or we’re, you know, I’ve actually had a seat at several

of those tables so to be able to think about like the other perspective or how someone else

might be showing up has been really helpful to me.

Absolutely, beautiful.

Well, your Kenya, Tanzania, Colorado River Watershed, DC, Adirondex, I have spent a lot of

time there myself, I absolutely love it, and also you lived in London for a spell, yeah?

Or it did for almost nine years.

And you maybe have a couple of funny story or two from your time in London, huh?

Yeah, so I’m a singer, I’m a classically trained singer, and I don’t know what 7-year-old

asks her parents for opera lessons, but I did show you how cool I was.

But I, yeah, so I grew up singing classically and I got to sing.

There was a ceremony between the Emperor of Japan and Prince Charles to open a Japanese

garden in London, so I got to go and sing a song in Japanese at this ceremony.

And so I was very nervous, I was probably eight or something, and Prince Charles for most

of the ceremony was standing on my foot, but I, you know, I was so nervous and I didn’t

want to say anything, and so I just did the whole thing like that, and just, you know,

kept it there.

My teacher was like, why didn’t you say anything?

It’s like, I don’t know, I don’t know, I’m going to like get in trouble, it’s been important

people.

Anyway, so yeah, I got some pretty cool opportunities when I was there, and grew up really as a British

We were one of, you know, my brothers and I were the only Americans in our school.

So it was a pretty amazing experience and way to be brought up, and then I came back

in high school to the U.S.

Well, I’m busy, like can you sing something for us?

I cannot.

Well, fair enough, I won’t either.

Great.

Well, and look, like you also shared with us, with Karesa, whom most, or at least many

of our masters know, you also practice Jinshin Jitsu.

And whoa, like I was not expecting to hear that today.

I know, I wasn’t expecting it either, we got the opportunity to meet and sort of introducing

ourselves, and that came up, it’s a special thing.

I’ve been doing it for, I don’t even know, 15 years probably.

And actually, because this has come up, I also got a parasite when I was on my study

abroad trip and came home, and that’s actually why I learned Jinshin Jitsu.

Oh my goodness.

I was in a hospital, figuring out all that when I came back.

And it was, in Marstown, New Jersey, and they were sort of, one of those experimental,

they had Jinshin practitioners come in.

If you wanted it.

And so I met a practitioner then, and was like, this is amazing.

I mean, how old was I, 21, right?

And thought like, whoa, this is really incredible stuff.

And so then I started the weekend course, I started the health health, self-help course,

and I’ve done, yeah.

I became a practitioner, and pretty kids, I had a practice in my house, and used to treat

people.

And now, right, like, I’ll hold my dog’s paw, or I’ll, you know, do all the things.

But yeah, it’s really powerful.

And something that, yeah, it’s like a lifelong gift to know about how to do.

Yeah, a lot of our ambassadors that are monthly meetups will be familiar with the three-minute

video, self-help.

Yeah, full of holiday songs.

All of them.

All of them.

Yeah, awesome.

And that is so amazing.

Well, and you’re also a runner and marathoner.

I mean, it’s like, okay, like Kate Wilson, like, certified badass, right?

Like, that’s an impression I get in your mom.

I like a challenge, right?

I like a challenge.

I have a lot of grit, maybe too much.

I mean, sometimes you apply that too much.

My team would be like, I can be a bulldozer also, right?

Like, the flip side of that is like, I push pretty hard.

But yeah, I think it’s fun, you know, having run a marathon last year, I decided to do

My latest thing is four months ago, I just started strength training and powerlifting.

Mm-hmm.

Because I knew nothing about it.

And honestly, it was, I was sort of intimidated, right as a woman to go into sort of a jam

with barbells and rigs and all these things.

Like, I had been really what I was avoiding.

Like, I was like, I’ll run.

I’m not going to do that.

But I go to this amazing gem in Boulder called Uplift and it’s like a very welcoming community.

And everyone just is where they are, right?

And so they teach you exactly how to use the equipment so it’s not intimidating anymore.

So it’s been really fun to go and learn.

And again, it’s growth mindset for me, all of these things, I’m like, okay, I’ll try

this, right?

This might be fun.

Let’s try this.

If it’s hard, that doesn’t scare me.

They scratch you.

Right.

It’s like, all right.

Like, let’s, we’re going to learn something from this.

So yeah, that’s my, that’s my latest.

I love it.

Crazy idea.

I love it.

I love it.

My son has done some training around weightlifting and fitness and it makes me think of him.

And, yeah, it’s beautiful, but to be into weightlifting is, it’s really impressive.

I mean, I’m learning a lot about it in terms of like longevity, right?

And, and health.

It’s a very, very exercise.

Right.

It’s like, really a healthy thing to do.

And I just, yeah, I just didn’t know.

It’s interesting to me, right?

It’s a lacrosse player and all these things, but the guys team went to the weight room,

but we never did.

Like, maybe that’s different now, but that was not how it went.

So I’m like, well, why didn’t we do that?

I’m sure they do now, but, but we didn’t.

So just with something, I have a lot of experience with.

And then when you run a lot and you get older, you have to do strength training.

You’re going to get hurt.

So that happened.

I was like, okay, but I want to be able to run forever.

Right?

I’m not trying to run to win something.

Most people in Boulder are already like, in the Olympics, so it’s fine.

So, but I want to, I thought I wanted to do it till a night, right?

And so it’s like, well, if you’re going to do that, you’re going to have to strength

training.

And then I just got really into strength training.

I love it.

Well, and of course, you’re a skier.

And, you know, I wanted to, I wanted to ask, are there like some funny stories?

Is there a funny story or a moment you can share with us from your time, like skiing

on the mountain or at work or whatever?

I mean, I just, it’s, I would say, you know, people think about, oh, veil, like, you

get to skill the time.

And like, I don’t get to see all the time.

But my team is, right, my team does.

And it’s just an amazing experience.

I will say one of the first times that I was skiing for work, that’s a weird thing to

say, right?

But like, I remember being on the chairlift with our former general counsel, thinking like,

this would have been a day I like, took off and played hooky in the past.

And right now, like, this is my job.

Right?

Like, I’m sitting here and this is literally what I’m supposed to do.

I think the other thing is like, just like the variability of what I get to do, right?

So thinking about like, I will, I have started the day in a suit doing a presentation somewhere,

then been in a ski uniform, you know, going around looking at the banana peels, making

sure they’re in the right spot.

And then, you know, I’ve gone to, like, put a hard hat on and gone to see an anaerobic

digester, which is where I’ll insult like city out of Park City, which is where I used

to go.

Right?

And gotten to do that.

So I just, I think it’s just, yeah, there’s just like so much of that stuff that happens.

And I think in terms of funny, right, it’s, I would just say it’s fun.

There’s so many experiences that I can think of with my team of being out there, just like

laughing, having it be a powder day.

One of my first, so you have to take a ski test before you can skiing uniform.

Right?

Because you need to, you need to at least have like a certain level of proficiency.

So I remember taking my ski test, and then it happened to be a day where we were doing

something called first tracks, so you go on the mountain before it’s open.

With patrol and whoever else in a group and you ski in a certain area, and it was, we

got to ski the back bowls of veil on a powder day.

Oh my gosh.

And it was like, this is my job.

Like, it was just such an incredible, you know, everyone’s yelling and like, it’s just

so exciting.

Exactly.

It’s just like so excited.

And you have those moments.

I’m like, wow.

Right, this is something that I love to do so much and to get to be, you know, doing this

as part of what my role is, is pretty, pretty incredible.

Amazing.

That was amazing.

That’s beautiful.

Well, in your mention of wearing different uniforms reminds me of an experience I had

back when I had our waste cooking oil recycling company working in the biofuels industry.

And one day, I was downtown Denver, suit and tie for a meeting to finance a project at

Piper Jaffrey up on the 30-some-odd floor of one of the hireises and parked and was walking

down along 16th Street Mall.

And because I had a suit and tie on, certain people would interact with me in certain ways.

Some people ignored me completely.

I guess assuming I was an asshole.

You know, I noticed some people said things like, you know, hycer and like open the door.

It was also just interesting in terms of the interaction with the women.

Like some women ignored me completely.

Others were interested in me because I had a suit and tie on, I guess.

And then the very next day, I was on one of my monthly recycling routes for quite some

I did this so that I stayed really close to the operations.

So now instead of a suit and tie, I was in a blue collar work uniform with my first name

right here and in the alley collecting cooking oil.

And now, because of how I’m dressed, I had a very different set of interactions.

And you know, some people were really like friendly and open and others were ignoring

Right?

Because I was like, nobody or whatever in their mind that day.

And it really, and I will say, I’ll admit to the ambassador network, like, so I think

women interacted differently, like, oh, here’s a guy who’s probably like strong and hard

working or whatever.

I don’t know what it was.

But it really struck me.

It’s like, whoa, like I’m the same person no matter what here.

But just because I’m wearing these different clothes and in these different roles in society,

people are, you know, responding with very different assumptions in it.

I’ve always been friendly with people, I think, in part because I moved a lot as a kid.

But it really opened up for me just how much folks, especially from certain segments of

our society are kind of kind of ignored and kind of like treated as if they’re not even

there.

It’s been, so I’m taking on this equity work for our company in the external part.

Like I’m thinking a lot about design thinking and thinking about different personas, right?

So putting on the hat of, like, what would it be like if I was an adaptive skier that

was coming to our resort in a wheelchair?

So I got to go to Park City has, so I call them a graph center and it’s an adaptive center.

We don’t own it, but we’re in partnership with them and it’s at the base of Park City.

And so I got to go this year and it was amazing.

Like half the parking lot, the closest spots obviously are handicapped parking.

There’s a ramp right there.

You go in and every desk is at wheelchair height, right?

And just thinking about like what would some place feel like and look like and be like

that fits me, right?

Or fits that person has been really incredible to start thinking about.

Like, well, and what if I was a single mom and I have to drop my kids off at their lessons.

So I can’t start my lesson at the same time because I can’t, right?

So it’s like, well, why do I need that to, my lesson to start half an hour later.

So I can get my kids to their spot or what if I was, you know, couldn’t, I can’t speak

English or it’s not my first language or what if, so like I’m spending a lot of time

thinking about this from different perspectives, if we’re really going to have the future of

the sport, be inclusion.

What does that feel like for all sorts of different types of people?

And what is that experience, right?

Like where do I park?

How do I use the restroom?

Where do I pay?

Right?

All those different things.

So I think it’s really helpful to kind of, yeah, take that perspective of what might

it feel like to be in a different body and a different mind and a different everything

and still want to enjoy this experience.

Mm-hmm.

That’s incredible.

I really, I think helps us develop empathy when we do that, right?

And mentioning a mom has a kind of scenario that you’re thinking about, like you’re a mom.

So in addition to all this stuff you’re doing, you’re also a mom, like holy smokes, like

that’s impressive, that’s incredible.

What do you think about with your kiddos relative to things like climate change and systemic

risk and opportunity and the, you know, perhaps moral imperative of working in service to

our communities?

How do you approach that as a mom?

I’m pretty transparent with my kids.

I mean, appropriate for their age, right?

But we have, you know, volunteering events that we do through dollar’s worth.

So, you know, last year we took them to a, two years ago we painted a school, last year

we did a park cleanup, right?

So I bring them with me to these things and talk about like, why are we doing it?

What, what, why are we doing this and, you know, I take them to our resorts and they’re,

they look at the, you know, kind of tell me how I’m doing based on how much trash they

Mm-hmm.

I had a hilarious thing that I haven’t actually, my daughter was like, you know, the tree

that always has like the beads and the bra on it, like we don’t take that down.

That’s part of like what ski culture, like so we leave, you know, not lots of those,

but we’ll leave like the one that has that.

So my daughter was like, mom, you were doing a terrible job.

Do you see this tree?

Like there are, there are stuff all over this, like aren’t you supposed to be cleaning

up the environment?

Um, so there.

You missed one mom.

Right.

She’s like, this doesn’t seem like it was doing very well.

Um, right, but so to show them kind of what, what is that like and, um, yeah, just making

sure that they understand like this is how we kind of take care of the earth, right?

This is how we take care of each other.

This is how we show up.

And so, um, yeah, we’ll see, we’ll see how it turns out, right?

Um, but they certainly, yeah, I think it’s important and, right, I’m, I’m working.

And so making sure that they know, um, why I’m doing that, you know, I had a conversation

with my daughter the other day about like, I’m sorry that I’m not the person that’s like

on the field trip every time.

And I’m not that mom, and she’s like, I guess what came on, like, I know what you’re doing,

right?

So I try to also show them of like, this is why I’m doing this.

This is really important to me, it’s important to the future, right?

This is why I’m doing anything they get that.

And there’s a tension around it, right?

Because there’s times when I do want to go on the field trip.

Um, and so just, yeah, figuring out which of course I can do, but just trying to figure

out like that balance, um, because I’m obviously really passionate about the work that I do.

Um, so making sure that I’m, you know, having that boundary around also just being their

Totally.

So great.

So beautiful.

It’s been such a pleasure and joy to have this time visiting with you today and, uh, thanks

for, you know, taking the additional time to visit behind the scenes for our ambassador

network.

And before we sign off for the day to day, um, I wanted to, uh, once again, just open

the floor up, uh, anything else you might like to share in particular with, with our

ambassador network, please, uh, my friend of floor’s years.

Yeah, I’m just, I’m appreciative to be here and to be among friends, right?

To be in a group where, um, I know, I know everyone out there is, is, um, working on these

things, right on themselves in their communities in the world.

Uh, and so it gives me, you know, that joy and that, you know, that sort of keep going

attitude.

I did get to, um, a couple of years ago, I got to meet Dr. Jane Goodall and we had, you

got to ask a question and I was in a green room with her and I got to ask her a question

and then I said, you know, how do you, how do you keep going, right?

When it’s just like so heavy and hard and, you know, we’re up against some pretty serious

stakes here.

Like how do you do it?

And she was like, you can’t not.

And I feel that deeply, right?

So it was just a really cool experience and then I, um, and she was like, do you want to

take a photo?

I was like, yes.

And then she was like, well, the way that you take a good photo is she put her arm around

my shoulder and looked at me.

She’s like, this is more authentic.

I was like, we should probably share the photo because I look like a three-year-old.

I’m so excited.

I’m like, can’t even handle it because I mean, she’s amazing.

So right, I think it’s just, we can’t not do it, right?

So we’ve got to keep going, um, and to be among a group of people that are, have that

message already and are passionate and committed to making change in the world is, is where

I want to be.

So thank you for the time.

Absolutely.

Uh-oh.

It was awesome.

Thank you, Kate.
