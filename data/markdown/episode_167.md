## Transcript

Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry, and today

we’re here in Crestone, Colorado, visiting with a couple of very special friends, John

Milton, the founder of The Way of Nature, and one of our YonEarth Community Ambassadors,

Bud Wilson. John, Bud, welcome.

Thank you.

Great to be here.

Really excited for our conversation today, and to have the opportunity, John, to dive deep into

your career, your work, your impact, and of course so much of that has been in collaboration

with Bud, and we’ve got a lot to talk about today.

John P. Milton is a pioneering ecologist, spiritual teacher, meditation master, vision

quest leader, and shaman. John’s vision quest and shamanic work began in the mid-1940s after

experiencing his first vision quest at the age of seven. Since the 1950s, John has guided

thousands of people into the wilderness, sharing with them experiences and practices that cultivate

a deep connection with nature and, ultimately, source awareness. Over the years, many have

sought his profound transmissions and powerful yet gentle Qigong teachings, Tai Chi training,

meditation practices, internal alchemy training, shamanic processes, and sacred passage programs.

John continues to live, explore, and lead wilderness trainings in many of the earth’s

wild and sacred places. Through way of nature, he offers nature quests, sacred passages,

advanced awareness trainings, as well as custom programs and retreats for both individuals and groups.

We’ve got several books that John’s written and or co-authored that will reference as well,

and, of course, we’ll be listing a lot of that in the show notes. But let me just ask, by first

inquiring, John, given your background and your experience, which, as we’ll talk about a little

later, includes work with the White House, why nature? What’s the big deal? Why does that even

matter? Why does wilderness even matter to us as humans? It was interesting. Thoreau

had a statement from his time in Solitude and Nature at the famous Walton Pond, and he made

the statement once, in Wildness is the preservation of the world. And what he meant by that is that

in that solitude and the depth of connection to all of nature, and to, when we say nature in the

way of nature, we mean outer nature and the whole family of living things, the ecosystems, and the

vertical global environment, and Mother Gaia, the earth, and also inner nature, the whole dance of

emotions, thoughts, the play of sight and sound, and touch and smell, movement and balance, and

the comprehension of energy flowing through us. We call those the nine experiential fields, so that

comprises the dance of how our inner nature begins to display. And then true nature is the source

level of being, the end of being that almost all the great spiritual traditions refer to

as the basis for all experience of life, the dance of life itself. So in order to come into

back, one of the biggest challenges of modern times is coming back into balance in harmony and good

relationship with the big family. We talk a lot about the big family of all living things. The

indigenous peoples always talk about all our relations, same thing. So we encourage coming

back into an experience of direct connection and communion with that big family of all living

things, all beings, and through that receive some of the wisdom of how to behave and function in a

way that is part of, harmony is part of that system. It guides our technology, it guides things

like AI. It can guide many of the facets of modern life that if we do not do that, we fall out of

harmony. We come back into these massive problems like climate change, the sixth extinction, and

the elimination of much of life, many of the catastrophes of environmental pollution, like

the plasticization of the planet, and the birth of all of these, everything from

round up, appearing in much of our food systems, poisoning the soil with these

nicotinamide types of poisons that kill every living thing in the soil.

Complete opposite of the indigenous way of viewing the earth. And the way of nature believes that

the soil and the water are two really fundamental parts of natural systems. So how do we come back

into harmony? Well, to come back into harmony, we have to come back into right relationship.

To come back into right relationship, you have to have good communication between yourself

and the rest of life. How do you accomplish that in life in cities and disconnect in urban

centers? You do that by setting some time aside on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis

to go deep into reconnection and re-immersion in the big family of all living things and drop

human culture for a while. So you’re empty and open and spacious. You can receive endless.

Beautiful. So I have to ask a sort of facetious or tongue-in-cheek question, although

at the heart of this question is something I’d really love to hear you speak to.

When I lived in New York City, that’s where I first went to university,

moving from the Rocky Mountain West, where my pals and I were often backpacking in wilderness and

spending a lot of time in nature. Being smack in the middle of Manhattan for weeks, you know,

a few days at a time is great, but for weeks created in me a palpable visceral experience

of what now professionals are referring to as nature deficit disorder, which I’m grateful for

the experience. But I’m wondering with folks, so many of us are living urban lifestyles and are so

caught up, we could say, in a variety of, we might say distractions, but maybe to be a bit more

generous, a variety of places that we’re focusing our attention, things we’re thinking about, things

we’re concerned about. And a whole lot of that, it seems to me, in the particularly the big urban

settings, is not necessarily very connected to nature. And moreover, often when we’re

suffering from nature deficit disorder, it seems we’re not even necessarily aware that that’s

a condition we might be suffering from. And so I’m curious, when you have the opportunity to speak

with folks who maybe aren’t yet tuned into the fact that there’s this whole other

aspect to the human experience, how do you go about discussing that with them?

Well, one of the first things I often ask people is what brings them joy and happiness in life.

And very often, I lived in my first apartment in New York was in West 11th Street,

across from St. Vincent Hospital in the West Village. And later I was in the upper

West Side in Spanish Harlem, to take my dates to the Apollo. And this was in the kind of in the

mid 60s period. Very cool. Good time to be there. Dylan was playing, you know, and I was at Washington

Square, like 8th and University, got to get to Chick Korea at the Blue Note. That was cool.

Absolutely. Cool. My dad knew Cap A.C. was a friend of his, and we used to go in and visit

Cap A.C. and go to the Blue Note. And he would sometimes be invited to come up and drum with

Cap A.C. So I grew up with a lot of New York in France. And I think the city has a lot to offer.

Yeah. It does have that perspective that the New Yorker and the famous poster,

where there’s Manhattan Islands. And then you can see kind of a landscape out there that’s sort

of flat. And then in the distance on the horizon is a little, a little steeple coming up, which was

the trans-American building, I think, in San Francisco. And that was the New Yorker’s view of

America. There’s something to it. So I ended up in that, my first job brought me to New York,

because we were based in that on, I think it was 40th Street, American Central Station.

And so I had these different apartments to live in, and I had a deep immersion building on what

I experienced as a kid. And what I discovered is that you could live in a little apartment.

And if you had one tree, I had an Alanthus tree in one of my little backyard,

a tree of heaven that’s called from China. And one of the Alanthus trees, which is considered

a weed tree in many places. But you could sit with that weed tree and begin to embrace and connect

to the life force of that tree, to the beauty of that tree. If you listened deeply, it could begin

to hear something with that tree and to offer you. If you could drop into an industry of

inner stillness and silence and space, there’s an openness to listen. And then you could begin

to establish a kind of natural communion with even a so-called weed tree in a tiny backyard

on 11th Street in New York City. And then the butterflies would come in and dance with the tree.

And nature would show up. It may be highly modified and simplified. It’s still there.

Our bodies are nature. We have the same, we have these amazing energy flows through our system.

We have all kinds of capacities to energetically connect. We have these beautiful gifts to be

able to see and hear and to touch. And those are vehicles for connectivity. If we begin to connect

with a tree, maybe go out to Central Park, spend a little time in a quiet part of the park.

And you can always find that quiet space and sort of connect with a beautiful tree or maybe

the elements, the soil, the earth, the water, the sky and the air, the spaciousness that contains

all of these elements of nature. And in the Chinese system, you have the earth element

providing a foundation for the stone element, or the middle element, providing a foundation

for the water element, providing a foundation for the wood element, trees grow out of soil,

and then for any main water, and then the wood element, for instance, the foundation for the

fire element. In the Tibetan and Ayurvedic systems, the fire element continues on to support

the air element, and then you have the air element supporting the opening of the space element.

So if you work with those seven elements to connect more deeply through the body and through the gift

of these nine fields of experience that we all have, then even in the middle of Manhattan,

you can have a deep and profound experience with the fundamental essence of life itself

and the planetary connection that we all have. That resonates for me. I’ve experienced that

directly. I’m also curious though, do you think there’s a qualitatively different

kind of experience we can have while we’re in wilderness?

Yes. In fact, because of my age, I was born in 38, and I was able to actually

run an expedition. I did many expeditions as a young man between 1516 and 30. I would find a

blank spot on that that said Unknown Territory or Tiarin Cognita, no history of modern humans going

into that place. Of course, indigenous peoples had inhabited most of the planet, but in terms of

modern humans, there were still a few places left where modern humans had not been. So I’d find those

places and places like the Brook Range of Northern Alaska or the Mackenzie Mountains of Northern

Canada, and then I’d take quite a few people crazy enough to go in with me. I’d go in for up to

three or four months at a time and just immerse myself in the wildness. The kind of wildness is

there because no human culture other than the early indigenous peoples had made able to be there.

So they were wild because of their remoteness, their difficulty to get there.

And there was a quality in that wildness that you do not find in the rest of

preserved wilderness. Once you draw that boundary to protect it, the quality of that space begins

to shift. And you begin to have these, one of my friends from many years ago, he used to call them

contemporary concentration camps for nature. Oh, interesting. And it’s kind of a weird

thought, but the idea there was that we’d reached a point where human culture was so dominant and

it allowed nature to be itself without human primary influence. We needed to have places where

nature could be free to unfold in its own natural way. We called those wildness places. Now, of

course, wildness means wild dearness. So originally from, especially from places like Ireland and

Scotland, this concept of wild dearness became a concept of wild places where nature could unfold

in an untrammeled fashion. And I’ve been a major proponent of preserving wilderness

in wild places in modern times because it is necessary. There’s a big difference between

going to a national park where you get a ton of people going through and going to a space where

you’re one of the few people maybe that walk through that in that particular given year.

And you’re surrounded by a family of living things that have a little bit of relationship to

humans, but not a lot. You’re living a very free life. There’s something very special that

happens when you enter that kind of system and become a little bit. And you begin to discover

that we are presential to re-wild ourselves and to rediscover the inherent capacity to

re-indigenize ourselves. So we live as part of the natural system in the way the ancient people

did. Part of my ancestral history goes back to the Mohawk people and

some of the other Eastern tribes. Those elements in our bloodlines give us a little bit of the

genetic memory that carries in the DNA that probably a part of the epigenetic system too.

And they reinvigorate us with that knowledge that there’s something very magical and very deep

when you tap into these ancient ways of being with nature. And a certain kind of wisdom can come

forth which we believe in the way of nature provides exactly the kind of wisdom we need

to bring forth a kind of technology and a way of living as humans in modern times that’s in

balance with the planet. So very important to reconnect with that wildness and celebrate it.

I love what you’re speaking to with the the epigenetics and the imprinting. And one of the

things I’ve experienced and explored and written about is that we all have the genetic imprints

of indigenous life ways in us by definition of being human on the planet. And I’m so struck by

the ways in which these imprints on you have allowed you to put your fingerprints on a whole lot of

what we’re experiencing in our world and especially here in the United States with

some of the environmental protection policies that you were instrumental in having under the

Nixon administration and so forth. We’re going to and we’re going to get into that but

you also mentioned something about these experiences you’ve had all around the world and I know

Bud you have been with John on a bunch of these amazing adventures. You’ve shared some

stories with me and I want to take this opportunity to thank you Bud for making this

connection and making this special conversation happen today. And you and I have been having so

much fun with the YonEarth community ambassador network and our work with the Lucille community

throughout the world and our gathering in Barcelona last fall. So yeah just a shout out of

gratitude to you Bud and I was hoping you could share with us from your perspective through your

eyes what some of these experiences and adventures have looked like and felt like and been.

Well let’s see how much time we have. So yes thank you for acknowledging all of that and thank you

for all of your extraordinary efforts with YonEarth and as John often refers to me as his

senior student. So I figured today you know here I’m sitting as exhibit A of John’s commitment

and dedication to really activating within each of us what you were just speaking of you know

whether it goes back to Neanderthal and Cromagnan we all have some of that trace and trace elements

within us and and I think what John’s capacity is to to work with each of us as individuals

to really re wild what we know is within us and yet it’s been covered over by the frantic

pace of our modern culture. So sometimes I like to refer to a teaching that John gave us about

separating from our identity initially as a part of the process and one of the ways that

that happens is by pushing the pause button on the prison of our self-importance and that’s a

phrase that I’ve often used with people because they when I first started I went down to the Baja

where John has had a lot of his work in the Baja Peninsula Mexico and when I got back to where

I was living at the time Sonomas Village in the mountains of Colorado people would say what in

the world did you go down there to hang out with John Milton for and for six nights and seven days

of alone time on the Pacific Ocean and in a solo site with no disruption from any human beings

and I would say well what I can tell you is there is a lot more going on in every nanosecond

than our western rational analytical reductionist conditioning has ever even thought of allowing

us to experience and during that very first sacred passage that I took with John as our teacher and

guide the earth actually literally breathed me instead of the other way around and what I think

one of the most profound teachings and lessons that I’ve come to appreciate from John is

surrendering to the magic and the mystery because it goes so far beyond everything that we are taught

from the time we’re little kids in kindergarten as a separation approach and building up your

identity and so I think then after much of our world travels together where we traveled into

Nepal and Thailand and Indonesia and that was just preparation to come back into the United States

and he asked me to guide some of his senior students in the Baja on my way back before I went up into

the Cochise stronghold of the Desert Mountains of Arizona for a 40-day solo and I was on quite a ride

I can tell you from my background and being conditioned you know so in this western mentality

and it really opened up a pathway of being able to surrender to what is and a couple of the

principles that John really emphasizes early on in the process of learning how to tap into our

deepest true nature is relaxation combined with presence and the present moment and being able to

be free of all of our thoughts of the past projections of the future that usually elevates

a sense of either fear or trepidation or regret and sadness and despair so you can cut through all of

that through the process that John offers through the way nature teaches and as I said I can go on

and on about that sort of value of pushing the pause button on our self-important engagement with

all the you know bells and whistles and bright and shiny objects that are constantly trying to get

our attention and distract us from what really really matters and one of the things that John was

saying when you were saying oh wow you know how do you tell somebody in a major dense human population

city that there’s something that nature has something to offer one of the real keys as well

is John alluded to the taker mentality going to nature what’s it going to give me today

what can I take away with me instead if you go in and just as another part of the core teachings

with an open heart and actually with your intention give back your love and appreciation

and gratitude to all that is yeah nature shows up in a profoundly different manner than what we

were accustomed to by just that level and it’s easily accomplished with conscious mindful awareness

so John often talks about these advanced awareness trainings well it is it’s about

shifting your awareness so that you can become fully present and there are lots of other stories

that we could share and that are you know that open up the pathway to the mystery

which i’m more than happy to share at some point yeah absolutely beautiful thank you bud

yeah it’s reminds me of one of my favorite little takeaways from Nietzsche’s work the gift

giving virtue as we enter into relationship in any manner or capacity to go into it with the spirit

of giving gift opens up so much for us to receive right there’s a reciprocity that emerges out of that

dynamic that’s beautiful and man we could go in so many directions right now i’m gonna

i’m gonna i’m gonna wind my reel a little here let me just add one more part of this

i love you bud because you always have more to ask well john as you know spoke to this trajectory from

thorough yeah right and so each era seems to have had a spokesperson for the core essential need

for human beings to come back into balance in nature and with nature and in army so john

really in this era is carrying on that lineage from thorough to

Muir Rachel Carson and john has chosen to be under the radar to a certain extent because he kind of

merges between walking in the halls of the powerfully elite in Washington D.C. as a as an

activist activist for policymaking and all of that level of our culture and our society

and then he also has gone deeper into being a a sage of wisdom for nature with the the capacity to

really synthesize all of these teachings from the great environmentally oriented

activists and the spiritual components that all of our great

wisdom teachers and wisdom tradition traditions have offered and so he fulfills that role of

synthesizing and bringing all of that into an easily accessible formula that

appeals to modern humans and so he’s carrying on that lineage and it’s so critically important

in the state of our emergence as a species if we want humanity to get through this gauntlet

of all the metacrisis we’re facing. Yeah, beautiful, thank you. And I want to mention for our audience

that there are many ways that each of us can connect in with this work you’re doing, John, and

the variety of resources you’ve made available, including there’s opportunities for folks to

come here to this part of our world in Crestone, Colorado with the Way of Nature Foundations

Sacred Lands, Sanctuary 300 acres of very special and just up the road from where we are

currently to many books and I’ve got one of them right here that I’ve been enjoying

spending some time with Sky Above Earth Below that I’m showing for folks who are tuning into the

video portion of our discussion and then you just gifted me before our taping today this

beautiful collection of leaves, of cards we can take with us into the wilderness cultivating

natural liberation and I noticed going through your body of work you’ve got some really wonderful

ways of organizing how we might approach these opportunities and imperatives we might even

say like the 12 principles of natural liberation and the six empowerment and I would love to

spend some time hearing from you talking us through some of what’s available to us

before getting there I also want to ask you a question that’s kind of burning for me.

How has it been for you to cultivate the balance needed as your bridging worlds one could say

when working in the halls of power in Washington DC for example and I’d love for you to tell us a

bit about the work you did back around the time of the Nixon administration you know there are very

strong forces at work of fear and separation and greed and power dynamics right that in many respects

are the archetypal antithesis to this whole other way of being in peaceful reciprocal

relationship as described in the original instructions and so forth and I’m wondering

would you reflect for us on your time in DC and your experience of how you were navigating that

day in and day out relative to all of this other wisdom and knowledge you have direct experience

with? Well I feel very fortunate that I was brought into DC I actually started in New York

which is part of what got me into the religion the Apollo theater places like that

that was the early 60s then the the head of the foundation was taken over by a man named Russell

Train who was originally from DC and he was a tax court judge originally and we he brought the

conservation foundation that I worked for which later merged with the World Wildlife Fund became

kind of the brain transfer World Wildlife Fund and it became one organization but in those days it

was separate called the Conservation Foundation and we were looking for him cutting-edge ways we

could invest and bring grants into things would help to move the culture into a more balanced

and harmonious way of living with with nature and of course there had been a lot of work done

on natural resources conservation and there were some real pioneers like Fairfield Osborn

these days probably very few people have heard that name he was the head of the Bronx Zoo

and he wrote a book in 19 published I think it was in 1948 called Our Plundered Planet

and that book became kind of a guideline for all those who have set the foundation that we’re

trying to figure out ways to become more skillful in what I mentioned and another hero or heroine

for us was Rachel Carson who brought into our understanding not only was the earth being

plundered but it was being poisoned and she brought in very clearly the effect of all kinds of

what happens when these pesticides and herbicides enter the environment and cycle through the

natural ecosystems of the planet and of course it herms us as humans as part of that system

and it has massively dangerous effects on all life for example in those days the bald eagle

almost went extinct our national bird through the sending of the shells of the bald eagle through

DDT pussy and it almost caused the eagle to become extinct fortunately we got a ban affected on the

use of DDT in such a widespread chaotic fashion and that led to the recovery of the bald eagle

it’s a really wonderful success story we need a few success stories I think that’s what I’m

so anyway but in those days the whole relationship was based on

what I call a taker mentality what can we get from nature that we want so it was not really

there’s no sense of being part of in the partnership relation much less in the family relationship

so what I noticed from my time would be indigenous peoples because I was already studying

and I spent a year with a Mayan shaman in the Lakanon tribe and one of the lessons I got from

that was how naturally and completely the tribe lived in absolute harmony with the rest of the

play of life and yes people got food we used to go out and hunk hunt uh well turkey and even

monkeys there’s nothing quite like seeing a monkey in a in a big bowl with an arm looking

like a baby it’s a bit scary but um the uh what I learned from that time was that these people

lived in such a way that they never took overtook anything from the forest they gathered handed

and gathered from the forest the amount of time they spent and this is true from us indigenous

cultures it takes about what would you say along it takes to to maintain a lifestyle in a indigenous

culture living in the ancient natural way yeah the number I remember hearing is four hours two to

four two three yeah two to three so two to three hours were spent in what you needed to take care

of the garden a bit of gathering in the rainforest do a bit of hunting to get a bit of meat for your

table and the rest of the of the of the day the other 22 hours were devoted to the arts to ceremony

to spiritual practice and cultivation to love making to enjoying the dance of life and displaying

a kind of basic creativity that is part of the great gift of being in these bodies in these lifetimes

and they had the time for it how many hours do you think folks spend today making a living

making a living or making money or what are we talking about here making money to make a living

yeah way too many probably what would you say how many out of the average day how much it’s

devoted to for the old western advanced culture we’re saying I don’t I don’t know what is it

nine ten well it’s probably if you take together the work time and then the time to take care of the

the bookkeeping the taxpaying the the keeping up of the car the house and so on uh which adds in

it easily another average four hours a day at least so you’ve got the eight hour work day

two and from ten hours maybe another four to six hours maybe involved in most all the waiting

on the obligations your kids everything to be a good father or mother yeah it gets up around

probably 16 to 18 hours a day yeah you’re left with how many hours not too many maybe four to six

yeah on the average compared to so they’ve got a system 16 hours a day to kind of keep going in

your modern context versus two hours yeah and everything else was open and available for creative

joyful experience I would say that if you look at from that perspective we’ve kind of devolved

right and we we lost that natural indigenous capacity to live in harmony let nature take care

of everything we shifted from nature taking care of everything which gave us a huge amount of time

to enjoy life to let’s control everything let’s manage everything well you try to manage everything

you would not you do not have the wisdom of the knowledge to be able to do that look at climate

change we only have a tiny understanding what’s happening to the global environment we can see

massive hurricanes appearing massive cyclones huge tornado systems that are unlike anything we’ve

done before historically temperatures in the ocean increasing massively air temperatures

increasing massively moisture moving from the oceans because they’re warm into a warmed atmosphere

which can hold a lot more moisture and then we wonder why these rains are coming that flood

everything out yeah more energy in the atmosphere I was part of a team that wrote a little publication

called in 1963 entitled the global implications of rising carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere

we predicted what we predicted was we didn’t know what the hell we were doing and that we could

predict that we were about to create massive instability in all the natural systems of the

planet that was 1963 just want to put an exclamation point behind that that was now

considered by global climate change people to be one of the early uh bringing of the research

that Roger Revelle and people like that did way going back into the the previous century yeah but

brought it up to date into modern times to get the word out they were headed for crash so all of this

to say human culture shifted from the kind of sustainable joyful life that I was describing

is the one where we get obsessively involved with increasing production increasing population sizes

uh increasing greed and need for maybe need and greed for consumer items

and we began to figure out ways to tap more and more of the earth’s reality to pull in things like

dammy up water create hydroelectric power yeah figure out ways to accumulate

uh uranium so we could create radioactive energies and mass massive amounts of things like

plutonium which should never have been created in this method it does not belong here and using

those new energy sources to feed the increasing consumption of energy and now we have things

like cryptocurrency that are producing massive demands of energy consumption again and so we’re

moving in a direction that continue to move in direction that uh looks on nature as a resource

that’s a basic thing to take from and use as a tool so the indigenous peoples always look on nature

as basically a family relationship you don’t treat your family as a resource to go ahead and take

from you’re part of a natural group of beings they’re working together hopefully in relative

harmony although in my we had a big family when you put the direct kids and the bigger the cousins

like we had cousins brothers and sisters grandparents yeah and the incidentals lived together in

one farm yeah and it was it was a quite a zoo okay i can imagine but it was a great opportunity to

learn how to live in community how do how do we this is to me this thread coming through

you know the recognition that our indigenous lifeways allow us so much more time for

joyful living and very high quality of life how do you approach the conversations with

folks in places like manhattan and inside the beltway do you see who are themselves devoting

14 16 18 hour days of very deliberate and often very stressful work and my experience is most of

the folks working in that kind of context find themselves or believe themselves to be doing

very important work how do you work how do you provide the trailheads and the bridging and

what’s what’s the solution recognizing you know if in fact our modern culture is so out of balance

where where do we go what are the trailheads what is what is the rhetoric of invitation

what are the uh do you have a more challenging difficult question to ask yeah yeah this is

we’re just starting off sorry yeah no i mean because this is to me this is the question right

yeah absolutely so um one of the underlying uh issues there is first of all what makes people

happy it brings true happiness yeah and uh including the beltway inhabitants and manhattan

and habit i’m very fortunate to have lived in the middle of manhattan and the beltway

appreciate that time but both the residents of both of those cities one for political power one for

finance probably the people that make up the that live there they all have one

underlining underlying uh need to live a happy life sure for you suffering as much as possible

yeah what they’ve been given is a life that’s often filled with suffering stress and anxiety and

speed um a kind of life that’s based on more and more consumer goods and consuming more and more

and that that would provide the basic happiness i’m sure you’ve probably all noticed that you

can get that wonderful thing that new car that new whatever new house and you have some happiness

for a short time but then that happiness begins to vaporize as you begin to pay the taxes take the car

let’s get this problem that you inherited with the car and you didn’t know about now you’re

gonna deal with it and um and these things begin to build up and you begin to find more and more

reasons to experience life is as painful and difficult now that reality is is true of all

living things they face that when you live in a in a simpler kind of lifestyle of most indigenous

people’s do is simpler because you’ve turned over the responsibility for the management of

of life itself to nature you surrendered to the inherent wisdom of mother gaya mother earth

and all life and that fundamental wisdom of self arising management takes care of in

everything i mean every ecosystem involved species that have co-evolved through each other

create systems that support the ideal kind of system for that particular climate and geology

and location so these ecosystems if we learn how to listen to what they offer we can go in

through and begin to create ways of relating to in a modern context with modern technology

that are in balance with that natural system this is the way it’s always been done even with

indigenous peoples so what i found was helpful when i lived in both new york and dc was i in

both places i had places to go to dc for example i bought a farm of snow up to 1200 acres with some

friends and i dedicated that farm to be being a place where people could come and drop let all

the cares and concerns of their political lives in dc drop that for a little while and begin to

connect to nature and themselves their own inner nature as well as the outer beautiful environment

there in the it was up on a place called shenandoa mountain it’s right in the middle of the shenandoa

valley i’m sure you’ve heard the beautiful song yeah that’s good so it’s a less cell farm and uh

so i’d bring people out there friends and those that i had known and give them a chance to taste

uh how simple and easy a natural way of living could be yeah i had a little organic farm going

out there and i didn’t say this is the whole answer to the issues of all life but people

could begin to see if then they began to reconnect with nature and natural systems these

uh very important cares begin to fall away and then they’d be replaced by wow what a beautiful

sunset look at the way the water is moving in that stream wow it’s so magical all these spirals

and whirls and bubbles i can spend hours just meditating enjoying the display of how the water

is moving fantastic and all this naturally provided by nature itself and their cares begin

to melt away and they found themselves experienced just a natural joy of existence of being a kind

of natural meditation hunters and fishermen accomplish that many times because they naturally

fall into that kind of relationship if you’re a good fisherman or a good hunter or my dad’s case

he was a very good he was a friend of Jack Cousteau and we used to go out into the ocean

in the earliest scuba equipment and he was also a glider pilot and an airplane pilot so we would

go up in the air and glide or fly and learn how to connect to the currents of the air and appreciate

those like in gliding especially sailplane how you learn to spot the thermals of air moving up

like this and you can move the glider over to that thermal just like an eagle would catch the

thermal and let it carry you up high enough so it begins to vaporize and then you begin to naturally

begin to glide down over the mountains and so you see another thermal in the distance with a big

thundered for starting to form you go for that just like all the eagles and the wheelchairs are

you catch the thermal and you go up again and you spend the whole day moving from thermal to

thermal riding the natural currents of the atmosphere and by doing that you learn to again

appreciate the natural display and dance of life and appreciate how the birds the eagles and the

turquoise has mastered that thousands upon thousands of years earlier and we’re experiencing

kind of a joy of life that you are so anything in nature can provide that sailing is another good

example you can simply by making that natural connection to natural systems you begin to

experience that inherent joy of life and that’s available to any Swedish city as well one other

thing I then began to spend some time I began to become interested in what was it in the indigenous

cultures that brought about that capacity to experience the natural joy of life well one

of the key things was something called the vision quest where you would go out as a teenager and

be alone in nature in a fairly powerful way that would tend to induce vision

and you’d be there for three or four days and nights in cases a bit longer and pray

cry out for a vision of who you were what is this lifetime for what is what is this life

what’s the meaning of life and what is my role in this natural existence a big family of any

things and very often you get the answer you’re given creative insight into what you’re here for

in those tribes that had that maintained virtually no juvenile fluency there was very little and the

cultures created ways of being in nature that were in harmony with nature they had technologies

but the technologies the part of the job of the culture was to find technologies that produced

balance harmony and contributed to a kind of integrity in the system that was because it was

a family relationship you don’t want to mess your family up and yourself so the vision quest

emerged as a very key element in what was being beneficial so i began to because i’ve been doing

vision quest since age seven i would do at least one a year sometimes i do two or three i did my

first month long in the olympic mountains in washington the low divide between the canalton

the queets and their systems probably you know those right in the very center of the olympic

and so and then later on i went on to do longer solos of two or three or four months at a time

and went deep and then i began to study with different masters of cultures that had provided

a way of deep connection to outer nature inner nature and true nature see what were their principles

and practices that allowed them to deep dive into connection and i realized all of them had a way of

connecting first to uh honoring that like they were somewhat disconnected when they

first arrived then they began to learn the skills of how do you fundamentally connect then go deeper

and have experiences of communion where you’re at one with different beings of nature but you’re

also still have a certain kind of individuated self at the same time that’s called communion

with the union then you would deeper in the community experience begin having experiences

of true unity with a tree with an element with a flow of water with a beautiful display of the

sky in the clouds and you begin to have these experiences of being absolutely one with each

being of nature where there was no separation and no need for individuation because the you

and the yet had gone there’s just one amazing happening that was filled with joy bliss and

and wisdom and then from the experience of unity when you do that with many different things

surrounding you you begin to have an experience of a natural mandala or sacred circle rising

and then when you embrace that fully you begin to realize that you’re part of an amazing sacred

fulfillment of a living system like an ecosystem but in a sacred way and then when you go deeper

with that you realize that there’s an opportunity or an invitation to follow the mandala or the

individual connection at the level of unity back into the fundamental pure consciousness pure awareness

pristine level of being to underline the mandala and that whole connection sequence and at that

point the whole experience becomes fully liberating and enlightening as it takes you directly back in

the source so I began to see that as a template for a pathway that may be universal that would allow

people to experience a tremendous connection to nature well at the same time begin a path through

enlightenment and that’s became the way of nature absolutely beautiful yeah pretty simple

pretty simple and speaking of enlightenment and thunder clouds I want to ask you about

lightning but before getting there I want to ask you just to describe for us specifically

just so folks know with the background here the work you were able to accomplish in DC and and

you know obviously

preserve a million acres of wilderness in Alaska you’ve helped to establish 130 million 130 million

yes well that is a lot more than 1 million your work has helped to establish national parks around

the world serve habitat for many species and as I understand it your work in DC helped to create

NEPA the National Environmental Protection Act I don’t know if I remember the accurate exactly

right but this led to Clean Air Act Clean Water Act the creation of the EPA can you just summarize

for us what happened at that time and what you were able to accomplish well I mentioned I was

going back from this farm back of course in DC so to help the shift from I realized from my early

vision quests that we needed to shift from a taker mentality to being part of the family

of all living things so to accomplish that we needed to have a new kind of language and a new

kind of kind of concept of what was going on and I began to search for a word that would bring

this concept of being part of a big family in a neutral way as I mentioned we had those books like

Rachel Carson’s book and that’s spring and then they put by our plunder planet by literally

pioneer yep and Osborne Osborne for field Osborne so I got together with a good friend of mine that

I don’t bring into the conservation foundation his name was Frank Darling he was later with

Osborne became Sir Frank honored by the English Queen anyway we came up with the idea of using

this word environment yeah be a replacement for resource resources taker mentality environment

is a natural system of which we are part totally different concept we did a gathering of big

conference bringing in different individuals to present on how they viewed this environment of

reality and we use North America’s an example in the beginning and basically out of that came a

book of quite a few chapters I think it was probably at least 30 or so and and we explored how

each expert in economics and regional planning and public policy and biology and the various

disciplines that were said to have had the answer to how do we come back into balance

they came in and made their contributions how their system of expertise could do that

and at the end of the gathering we all realized none of those systems could do that alone

they had to work together in the context of a philosophical and experiential framework

that was based on being part of natural systems or part of the environment so the word environment

took on tremendous currency because the leaders of all these different disciplines were there

and they saw that if they didn’t bring them all together into one system there was a life

connected it was kind of a hopeless situation it was going to lead to more separation we’re just

discontinuing more more rape and pillage and no harmony at all with with life so at the end of

that gathering we produced a book called the future environments of North America and that helped

to brand the term environment solidly in 1965 as a foundational word to bring in that whole system

perspective and it kind of grew it goes on and grew and grew many people got involved

that was just one of those and we should really underscore the value of that distinction I mean

that puts John right there with that lineage of thorough you know register crossing to be able to

offer to human beings a whole new perspective about the environment

so either that came uh I mean much to our surprise that word caught on and boom

suddenly there was an environmental movement and uh looking back on it was it was just the

right thing in the right way at the right time pretty simple amazing beautiful yeah

so I think if we had any uh if there was a magic it was because it was exactly the right thing

needed exactly at the right time when the culture was ripe and ready to hear that message were that

good news and uh it’s the right thing in the right way because we gather all the topics for

it’s of the day and so we had the right thing in the right way at the right time and it provided

a catalytic transformer effective birth to movement yeah and then the movement took over

you had earth day and all kinds of stuff coming out of that yeah and uh and then we did some work

for I decided well this is great but we need to have a truly global view here yeah so I

I bought together with a friend of mine who is from Iran his name was Muhammad

Taghi Fafar a true Islamic brilliant man who worked with the
