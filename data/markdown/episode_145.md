## About Chief Sustainability Officers

Chief Sustainability Officers – or CSOs – are a recent addition to the C-suite of companies, cities, airports, and other large institutions, and serve as a strategy and policy-setting, implementation, and coordination nexus within the ecosystem (and among its myriad stakeholders) to improve environmental, social, and financial performance. The City of Denver was the second city in the United States (after Las Vegas) to establish a CSO position. Under Mayor Michael Hancock, who emphasized “scaling” solutions and inclusion (“everybody plays”), Mr. Tinianow not only transformed the sustainability profile of Denver, but has also had far-reaching impact throughout Colorado, the United States, and beyond, often in coordination with other Chief Sustainability Officers.

Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today

we’re visiting with Jerry Tinianow, the founder of Western Urban Sustainability Advisors.

Jerry, how you doing?

I’m great. And thank you for the correct pronunciation of my name. You’re a minority

of about 2% of all humans who can do that.

Well I appreciate the acknowledgement and I will cop to having asked you just a few

minutes ago the correct pronunciation because I wasn’t certain. Tinianow like Tiano, it’s

a nice way to think about it.

Yeah. But I’m doing great looking forward to our conversation today.

Likewise, likewise, Jerry. Jerry Tinianow is the proprietor of Western Urban Sustainability

Advisors LLC. West Irb assists local governments in creating and improving sustainability programs.

It also works with vendors that sell products or services to such programs and interest groups

that want to improve local sustainability policies. Jerry’s work at West Irb reflects

the successes he achieved at Denver’s, as Denver’s first chief sustainability officer

from 2012 to 2019, where under his leadership, the city of Denver became the fifth U.S.

city certified at the platinum level of the U.S. Green Building Council’s lead for

city’s program. That’s leadership in environmental and energy and environmental design. And

during his tenure, Denver was also included in the A list of top performing cities in climate

change reporting and action by the International Climate Change Organization, CDP, which was

formerly known as the Climate Disclosure Project.

Jerry previously served as a national officer of both the Sierra Club and the National Audubon

Society and directed the Center for Energy and Environment at the Mid Ohio Regional Planning

Commission. The Sierra Club designated him a national environmental hero during its

centennial celebration. Prior to his sustainability career, Jerry was a partner and commercial

trial attorney with two of Ohio’s largest law firms. He received his undergraduate and

law degrees from George Washington University and he was the 2018 winner of the Worth Chair

Sustainability Award given by the University of Colorado, which Jerry, not all of our audience

will necessarily know about yet, but I will be the first to say that here in the state

of Colorado, this is one of, if not the most prestigious sustainability awards one can

receive concerning especially work within the institutions and institutional level here

in the state. So I’m not, you know, congratulations, obviously, very well deserved.

Thank you and it’s kind of interesting because the award is named after former Colorado

Senator Timothy Worth, who was elected in the Watergate year in 1974 and oddly enough, in

1975 when I was in college and started working part time on Capitol Hill, I met Senator

Worth when he was just a congressman, when he had just been elected. So it’s funny, I met

him in 1975 and then 2018 suddenly I get an award named after a long time in between.

Wow, that’s great. I love the how that’s full circle. So Jerry, you know, I first became

aware of you, your role with the city and county of Denver, your work as a chief sustainability

officer, which I may refer to as a CSO through the conversation here. When I was working

in the food arena, running a food hub here in the state and boy, you’ve accomplished

so much in that arena and touched on so many different industries and lives and sectors

of our economies, our communities. And I want to make sure I think many of our audience

are very aware of what chief sustainability officers are and do. And thankfully this

has become a major trend in movement in the world. But for those who maybe aren’t as

familiar, could you just describe for us what is a chief sustainability officer and what

were you doing when you’re in that role for the city and county of Denver?

It’s a term that’s really come into vogue in the last 10 to 15 years, let’s say. It’s

relatively new in that when I was appointed in Denver in 2012, there were only two cities

in the United States that had a chief sustainability officer, Denver and Las Vegas, which was

the first, interestingly enough. It’s also a term that’s made its way into the corporate world.

Many, many companies now have chief sustainability officers. Many local governments now have them,

not so much at the state level, but particularly at the local level, cities, counties, towns,

you know, have them. The role differs in different communities. In the case of Denver,

it was in the mayor’s office. And so there we were working with all of the different departments

and city governments in our city government. And we have a combined city and county government

to 13,000 employees. And we were working with them to implement the mayor’s sustainability

vision, which was that everyone would have access or affordable access to the basic resources

both today and tomorrow. People define sustainability differently. That’s what I say. It’s

different depending on which community you’re in. In some communities, the office is programmatic,

meaning that they are running actual programs out of that office. They might be, for example,

doing a recycling education program or a program on energy saving in the home. That’s the way it

structured some places, other places like in Denver, all of the programs were out in the city’s

departments. We didn’t run anything out of our office. We worked with them to do it. And the

mayor structured it that way, because he wanted sustainability to be a core business value

of the entire city government, all of the departments. He did not want to segregate

the sustainability programs in our office, because then we’d be the little green ornament on

the tree. That’s where the sustainability stuff is happening. Everyone else was doing business

as usual. And our mayor, Michael B. Hancock, did not want to do things that way. It is on that way

in some other cities. And then in corporations, you know, it’s different there, because corporations

really are just looking inward to their own operations. And so there, this piece of sustainability

officer again can play many different roles depending on how it’s structured. Sometimes it comes

out of the marketing department, and it’s mainly a marketing tool. Other times, it comes out of

product development or engineering. Sometimes it comes out of governance. There may be a board

position and so forth. So it doesn’t mean the same thing everywhere, but generally seeing

you’re looking across that broad range of issues that you mentioned a moment ago. You’re looking

at energy and you’re looking at waste and you’re looking at food and you’re looking at water

conservation and pollution and mobility traveling around and and later resources and things like

that. You work with all of it. That’s why sustainability as a profession is so wonderful if

you’re a person like me who really wants to be into everything, basically. Loves to see how all

the dots are connected. Lo is a very interesting approach to decentralize the mechanisms and

empower a whole bunch of others in the fabric of the community. Right. And you know, I always tell

people when they say, well, that sustainability officer, that’s a new position. Look, the reality

is that cities have always had huge sustainability officers for decades. They just don’t call them

chief sustainability officers. Sometimes the head of the city public works department is

effectively the chief sustainability officer. Sometimes it’s the head of the planning department.

You know, there’s always someone who’s doing this, you know, acting in this capacity. And the

reason for that is in my opinion, sustainability really goes back to Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin

was the founder of sustainability in the United States and he wrote about it in poor Richard’s

Almanac. He wrote down a lot of the principles that we use today like a penny save as a penny earn

or a stitch in time saves nine. You know, really these concepts have been around for decades and

decades. The term the title is new, but the principles of sustainability have been around for a long time.

So wonderful. It’s amazing to me how much our modern world despite all of these technological

advances has been profoundly influenced by Ben Franklin in particular among many of the

framers from that time. Yeah, that radical guy Ben Franklin. Yeah, if I have it correctly,

I believe that he was instrumental in establishing a postal system, the idea of community

firefighting capabilities, even forms of insurance that helps spread risk in the community. I mean,

he does so much. Right. Yeah, and those principles have come down to us, although the term sustainability,

even when I was in college in the 70s wasn’t really around yet, but the idea that it’s been around

for a long time. And often when you’re looking for programs and sustainability when you’re

thinking about what could we do? What would really work here? You don’t have to invent something new.

You have to go back to something old that worked for a long, long time and that we got away from

and forgotten about. You know, when you look at a lot of cities, part of their sustainability

program is urban gardens. Well, urban gardens are gardening, you know, publicly is not a new thing.

It’s been around for a long time. And World War II, you know, 40% of produce in the United

States was grown in neighborhood gardens. And so we’d have to invent something new when we

created urban gardens. We have to go back in time to things that worked well a long time ago

and are ready to be resuscitated. You know, a lot of towns are now starting to

experiment with things called repair fairs where they bring, you know, skill tradesmen and

tradespeople into a central location and you bring yourself down and have it repaired instead

of throwing it out, you know, to keep it out of the landfill. Again, nothing new about repair

or repairing things rather than throwing them out. In fact, I’ve always gotten a kick out of the

fact that a lot of what is called sustainability now is what used to be called being cheap or

being a cheap state, you know, saving that ball of string or whatever or saving all of your

hangers instead of throwing them out. That, you know, sustainability used to be called being a

cheap state. But, you know, that means a lot to me because my grandfather started out in this

country over a hundred years ago, going around the countryside near where he lived in Lado, Ohio

and picking up scrap metal and taking it to foundries. You know, we call that recycling now,

the 2020 census described his profession as junk peddler. So it used to be junk peddling now

it’s recycling. It’s been around for a long, long time. No doubt it reminds me of my grandparents

as well and it turns out when I was a relatively young man, I was getting into sustainability,

permaculture, etc., and not to throw any of them under the bus, but my parents and aunts and

uncles generation at the time didn’t really quite get where I was coming from. But when I was talking

with my grandpa who grew up in the depression and was actually a prisoner of war during World War

II in Germany, Nazi Germany, he got it immediately. He said, you’re absolutely right and he said

something else that has stuck with me all these years, he said, the way our society has gone now

is so far off track and off course. And he knew, I was in his garden talking with him at the time,

he knew things like the relocalization of food production and so forth was essential to the

resilience and sustainability of our neighborhoods, our communities, our families. And so yeah,

I really resonate with the way you’re framing this in terms of returning back to

things that were common practice, not too terribly long ago, really, in the ski no-shakes.

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what we call local food today used to be called food.

I mean, it was almost all local or nearby and so forth. There’s nothing new about it.

What’s new is the way the food system evolved into this thing where food travels hundreds

or thousands of miles to get to us. That’s new. Local food is more traditional, it’s going back to our

roots. Indeed, yeah, and I’d love pointing out as well that what we now call organic food,

we used to call food, right? Like up until about 100 years ago, all food for thousands and

thousands of years was organic by definition. And when I started working in what we now call

sustainability when I was in college on the staff of a congressman from Montana, and he got me

into this, he asked me to work on what was then called alternative energy, solar energy. Wind

hadn’t really come along yet, but solar energy, geothermal energy, it was just coming into its own,

and my goal, my hope, as I’m hearing the end of my career, is that we can apply the term alternative

energy to gasoline, coal, oil, you know, those types of energy. Our view is alternative energy,

and what we now call renewable energy is the basic or default system of energy to shut off,

you know, how far things have come over the period of my career.

I love it. Yeah, the term anomalous is coming to mind for me.

Yeah, right. Can you remind me just, I want to get it down in my notes here. What

percentage of our food were we growing in our gardens during World War II?

It was not all food, it was produce, and it was about 40% at maxed up, or called victory gardens

in the world wars, and it reached about 40%. The distinction between food and produce is

important too, because large segments of the food system really cannot be produced in cities.

You know, you can’t produce grain in large quantities in cities, and you really can’t produce

meat in large quantities in cities. You can do a little bit with, you know, some forms of

aquaculture and things like that, but really the whole food system requires a region not a city,

but the produce, that part of, you know, the food chain of the food system, that can be done

very locally, and that’s where the big comeback is happening right now.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely wonderful, and I love to circle back on the food piece with you,

because as you know, it’s very near and dear to my heart, but let me first ask you, so now you’re

finished with your role at the city and county of Denver as Chief Sustainability Officer,

and you have more recently launched your company, Western Urban Sustainability Advisors.

Can you tell us a bit about what you’re doing and whom you’re serving through the new company?

I wanted to take the lessons that I learned as Denver’s Chief Sustainability Officer for seven

years and apply them to other local governments in Colorado and elsewhere, and so I offer my

services to communities that are creating sustainability plans, updating sustainability plans,

creating climate action plans, creating individual programs, you know, within those plans.

I typically work in partnerships with other organizations simply because, you know, when you

first become a consultant and you look at requests for proposals from various entities, they always say,

well, give us a list of three other projects that you’ve done that are like this one.

And coming out of government, I wasn’t any, I was not working in the private sector.

So I typically partner with other companies I’m on a team. I do have one project I’m working on

right now, which is just me, it’s helping the big strike community up in Montana, implement the

climate action program that they put together earlier this year, earlier in 2023. But for the most part,

you know, it’s doing what I did as Chief Sustainability Officer in terms of planning,

programming and things like that, but without all the bureaucracy of, you know, being an officer

in the city government, I leave that to the to the client now.

So interesting, you know, we recently had on Nathan Stuck on a podcast episode who has a company

called Profitable Purpose Consulting and he’s helping a whole number of companies and organizations

out there get be certified and or prepare for the pathway to becoming be certified. And I’m curious,

just sort of thinking about possible connections here. How might you and your offerings, you know,

differ from and or complement, you know, something like what Nathan and his team are offering,

particularly I’m thinking here for the private sector because we had mentioned you’re working both

with municipal scale governmental entities as well as the private sectors, that correct?

I do a little bit of work with the private sector, not too much. Generally, if someone in the private

sector has a product or service that really strikes me as something with tremendous potential

and they want to make a link to local governments, they either want to sell it to a local government

or they really need local governments to make some changes in their laws to open the door for what

it is they’re doing with their product or service, then I will help a private business. But I’m not

doing general business consulting, you know, someone who’s helping companies become be corporations

which does tie into record sustainability, that’s entirely in the private sector. Their clients are

all going to be private sector companies. There is no, you know, be company or be corporation

rating for local governments. It’s entirely private sector. But the issues we’re working on are

probably very similar. You know, I’m helping the local government pursue sustainability issues,

they’re helping private companies do the same thing. Yeah, in your bio, we mentioned that Denver

became the fifth city certified under the U.S. Green Building Council’s lead, platinum level

certification. I’m assuming just because of what I know about the U.S. Green Building Council,

that pertain primarily to the buildings, the built environment and related infrastructure.

Is that true A and B? Are there other certifications for cities and municipalities that speak to

other dimensions of the sustainability fabric? Well, lead for cities and communities

actually grew out of the buildings program of the U.S. Green Building Council. But it evolved

from a recognition that there was more to sustainability than just buildings. So what a city does

in regulating its buildings, in its own buildings and regulating private buildings is part of what

goes into our certification as a lead city. But there’s a lot of other things that go into it too.

You know, you look at the city’s solid waste systems and what the city is doing with energy

and water and what it’s doing with land use and mobility and so forth and so on. And like with

the buildings part of lead, the city basically says this is what we’re doing and they get points

for doing certain things or achieving certain things or hitting certain benchmarks. And then you

add those points up and you see what level of certification that they’re going to get. So yes,

it is buildings, but really it also goes well beyond buildings. And it’s also the two part program

lead for cities is a certification of local government like a city or a county. But there’s also

lead for communities, which are big kind of like cities. But they’re more than just a building.

They could be more like a campus, but they’re not a local government. You know, Rockefeller Center

in New York, which is a combination of buildings that’s a lead for communities certified

area. Airports can be certified as lead for communities communities. So really, you’re looking

to bridge the US Green Building Council’s program from the individual buildings up to much larger

units. But they do play with each other in the sense that it’s probably easier to develop a

lead green building if your city is lead certified because one of the things that your city is done

to get that certification is to really open up the door and make it easier for individual

developers to develop green buildings, green neighborhoods and so forth. There are other

green systems, somewhat similar. You know, there’s the global compact of mayors, which has certain

requirements of mayors relating to climate. There are standards for healthy buildings. There’s

the well-building standard. There are other systems out there. I like USGBC. I like lead because it’s

been around for so long. It has such a strong brand. It’s very rigorous and therefore very

trustworthy. Yeah, it really, it really seems to have become the gold or platinum stand.

And I’m curious, do you have a sense for how many cities around the United States, you know,

large major cities, medium-sized cities, and or internationally have already attained some level

of lead certification? In terms of cities and cities can include counties, we’re probably

somewhere between somewhere around 100, maybe worldwide, you know, not a lot. Although many of

those that have it, I think it are larger cities like Denver, you know, Denver is gotten there,

Washington, DC, Phoenix, places like that, Arlington, Virginia. Communities smaller number,

most of the communities are overseas. There’s a program is particularly strong in East Asia and

South Asia, and it’s gaining strength in the Gulf States, you know, the Persian Gulf. Again,

they’re not a lot right now, but like any other program, you know, you wanted to grow or you

wanted to expand, and you want to see exponential growth. So it, both of those programs have grown

every single year since they started, and we’re getting to larger and larger numbers. So hopefully

we’ll see more and more cities, counties, and so forth getting that certification.

Yeah, that’s wonderful to hear about. And very interesting to think about the interconnection,

where if a city’s already certified, it makes it easier for a particular building or project or

community to get certified. I love hearing that because it speaks to the the interconnection

of all of these different systems and modalities. Right. Yeah, the important thing is that the lead

certification has to mean something. You know, like you can talk about where we’ve certified,

and if a reaction of everyone is, what does that mean? But I can tell you, when we do

certify when the U.S. Green Building Council does certify cities, they always celebrate.

There’s a hoes of press conference. There’s always a photo with the mayor and city officials

probably holding up that certificate and so forth. So clearly it does mean something. Just like

with buildings, you know, when the buildings program was getting started, and people would earn

that certification for their building, there’d always be a process of that or a media event

or something in the corporate report showing that lead plaque that’s on the building. So

the reason the program succeeds is because the U.S. Green Building Council has made the certification

mean something. And it’s got to keep doing that. But that’s why it’s a rock solid system. That’s

why it’s lasted a long time. You know, the buildings program has been around for over 20 years.

So and it’s funny because when I was with the National Audubon Society, I developed my one and only

lead building. It was a nature education center that we developed in Columbus, Ohio. And it was

lead gold. It was one of the first buildings in Ohio to go after lead. And I remember when I was

learning lead, you know, in order to build this building, my reaction was, oh, this is never going

to last. This is never going to last. This is too, this is too cumbersome. It’s too hard. You know,

and no one’s going to do this. And I learned the hard way to never bet against the U.S. Green

Building Council because the program has been a phenomenal success. And I learned the hard way.

I learned by doing just how rigorous it is. And therefore just how valuable that certification

is when you get it. Yeah, that’s so great to you. Yeah. Back when I was in graduate school, I

mentioned to you prior to our recording here that I was working for a Green Buildings material

company. My friend David Adams and founded and continues to run. And we would get all of these

wonderful publications from the U.S. Green Building Council on all manner of built environment

systems and structures and design strategies. And yeah, it’s amazing to step back and consider

for just a moment how much incredibly good impact that one organization has had all around

the world just in the last couple of decades. Yeah, and that’s due to a very dedicated staff

that, again, is very rigorous in what they do. If you’ve ever, for example, been a speaker at

a U.S. Green Building Council conference, you have no idea the hoops you have to jump through,

just to be approved to speak and then have your presentation approved. I’ve never seen it anywhere

else, but that’s why their conferences are such high quality because they put the effort in

up front to make sure that everything is done to my standard. Yeah, so wonderful to hear. Well,

I have to ask because I’m curious, you mentioned airports and back in the day are recycling and

food distribution companies had business at Denver International Airport, one of the largest

busiest in the country and even worldwide. And a really notable and somewhat storied airport,

including with like conspiracy theories and all kinds of strange, mysterious lore surrounding it.

I’m curious in your role as CSO for Denver, did you have a lot to do with the airport and was

there a lot going on there in terms of sustainability efforts? I did have a lot to do with the airport

because in Denver, unlike many other cities, the airport, Denver International Airport is actually

a city department. It’s actually a department of Denver government, so it’s controlled by the city

and county of Denver and therefore it was subject to the work I was pursuing as the chief sustainability

offer. And I have to say, Denver International Airport has a very impressive track record in the

area of sustainability. I cannot take personal credit for a lot of it. You know, I worked with them,

but they have done some remarkable things out there. Just as an example, something that happens

behind the scenes, people don’t even know about. You know in the winter, when you fly out of an

airport like Denver, you have to have the plane diced with this chemical. So what happens to that

chemical, you know, when they when they when they sprayed over the plane? When many airports,

it’s it’s just sent into the sewer system or like LaGuardia, they used to and maybe they still do,

they they would just plow it into the long miles out. Denver actually collects it and has a recycling

plant on the site of Denver International Airport. You’ll never see this as a passenger, but I got

a back stage door. They actually have a recycling plant right at the airport to recycle that stuff,

so it doesn’t get into the environment. And that’s pretty remarkable. They also have a really

remarkable food recovery or waste food recovery program where they started out and they put a big

freezer in the airport. And they asked all of their vendors, you know, if you have left over food,

not, you know, waste, not scraps from the diner’s table, but food that you bought meant for whatever

reason you can’t use it. Could you give it to us, hold distributed to hunger shelters? That program

is so successful that they had to expand that refrigerator by a factor of five, you know, to take

in all of the waste food that was being offered by the vendors. And so that’s really a remarkable

thing that they’re doing. I’ve seen machines they have for recycling, florescent bulbs. They have

a way of recycling all the plastic packaging and wrapping that comes off of freight.

It comes into the airport. So they’re doing an awful lot out there. If you’ve been out there,

you’ve probably seen the solar arrays that you go by when you’re going into the airport. But that’s

really just the tip of the iceberg. So Denverites can be really proud of the airport. It truly is

one of the greenest airports in the world. Well, I got to ask, I can’t help myself. So what

of all these conspiracy theories out there, do you think? Well, for those of your viewers who don’t

know about this, they’ve been conspiracy theories about the airport for a long, long time.

All you have to do is keyword search Denver Airport conspiracy. And you’ll see all the YouTube

videos and so forth. There’s a number of things. There’s, you know, the air, the building was originally

going to have this underground handling system for the luggage that never really got built. But

there’s this big supposedly empty underground area that’s been rumored to, you know, house,

the landing place for the world government. You know, when the apocalypse comes, they’re all going

to go down there. The runways, if you look at them from above, they kind of look a little bit like

a swastika, which was supposed to be, you know, a symbol of something. There’s some artwork in the

airport that supposedly sends these signals. He would search Denver Airport conspiracy. And you’ll

have to see it for yourself. There was one thing, though, I asked the airport director about this.

There was one part that was true. One of the conspiracies is that apparently the British Royal family

threw a bunch of corporations that they created under other names, has bought up a lot of land

near the airport. Now, the conspiracy theorists said that’s because the British Royal family is

also supposed to go there just before the apocalypse happens. They want to have those lines of work.

Well, the airport director at the time said that’s not what they buy, but they do earn a lot of

property under other corporate names near the Denver International Airport. That part of it is true.

Most of it is not true, but it is pretty funny. And I used to tease the airport director about it.

And I told her, you know, when that, when those doors close and the apocalypse was here, I want you

to be sure I’m inside of it with my family. Yeah, that’s so interesting. It reminds me a little bit,

too, of lore around Henry Kissinger and others owning land in southern Colorado, maybe for similar

reasons. And I actually can’t help but mentioning, I play with some of these themes, especially

at the airport in my novel Veridi Toss, when the charge of Brigitte, so if you have to fly into

Colorado and go through the airport, it actually goes by some of the artwork you’re referencing,

some of these paintings with amazing symbolry and so forth. And, you know, of course, with the swastika,

many of us affiliate this with the horrors and atrocities of Nazi Germany, but maybe not as many

of us are aware that this is a sacred symbol to many peoples, the ancient folks in the Himalayas,

the ancient Hindu tradition. And Hobi and other Native American traditions also use this symbol,

although not necessarily oriented the same way that the Nazi Germany, but yeah, it’s kind of fun

to think about these things and laugh a little bit about them. Well, as the airport director

pointed out to me, if you actually look at the runways, it’s backwards from what the actual swastika

is doing. It’s an interesting theory, you know, we got some laughs out of it.

Oh my gosh.

I just love thinking about the arc of your career and of course we ran into

each other this past April at the Earth X gathering in Dallas around Earth Day

and I got to ask you know how does somebody who starts out in a legal

career right you’re a lawyer end up doing all of this other work how does

something like that unfold over time I actually started before law school as I

mentioned I went to undergraduate school at George Washington University I

wanted to work on Capitol Hill during during law school and during college and I

was able to work for a young freshman from Montana named Maddoz Valka’s and I

didn’t have any agenda I didn’t have any particular issue that I was working

on but he said I want you to work on alternative energy agriculture or

street natural resources things like that you also sent me out to Montana

during my summers to work in his district and I just fell in love with the West

I fell in love with those issues and so I carried it into law school while I was

here I worked for the Sierra Club legal defense fund which is now called

justice and then when I went back home to Cleveland which was where I’m from to

practice law I also continued my involvement with the Sierra Club as a

volunteer so really you know I didn’t set out to be a sustainability guy I just

kind of stumbled into it but profession as we now know it didn’t really exist

back then what I started doing all this stuff as a volunteer worked my way up the

ladder on the volunteer side of this year club as a local group chair in the

state chair in a regional vice president and national vice president and then

I decided I wanted to do at full-time and from when I decided that until when I

got a full-time job was ten years because I then I was living and working in

Columbus I’d been transferred to another office in our welfare and I could just

back then and just weren’t a lot of jobs anywhere other than on the coast so

took me ten years I finally got the job thought upon that took me into the

regional planning commission got the invitation to come to Denver to be the

two sustainability officer and you know I didn’t plan it this way and I’ll tell

you one other thing and if back then when I was working in Capitol Hill and

in college and everything if someone had told me when you come out of law school

you’re gonna have one government job when your life and it’ll be working for a

city I would have told them they were nuts I would have said are you

kidding a city that’s where you know that’s where corruption occurs that’s

where they pick up garbage that’s where they fill panels what can I possibly do

in a city that would be of any importance and yet you know by the time I finally

got that job in 2012 cities were where it was at you know the frozen but the

federal government was frozen up the state government’s not doing too well but

at the city level at the local level that’s where you can really get things done

and anyone who’s watching this and thinking of a career and sustainability take a

look at local government because I think that’s where the most exciting stuff

happens yeah it’s so cool I want it I want to ask especially at your time with

the city what are some of the accomplishments that you’re most proud of and

that you think have had the most perhaps the most impact you know we took

the what was with the mayor mayor handcock referred to as a marketing program

a program called green print which is predecessor had run and we totally

altered its focus the mayor gave me a four-word agenda four words which was

scale and everybody plays so he wanted us to focus on moving big numbers not

little stuff not little you know demonstration projects or whatever and it

was funny because my first day on the job when the staff of the old

office was giving me the tour at the end one of the women on the staff said to me

you know what I hope you could really accomplish while you’re here I hope you

can really get the mayor to stop drinking out of his styrofoam crop and the

mayor told me scale and everybody plays and I didn’t say anything to I but I

said boy do I have a lot more to go here if that’s what they’re thinking

it’s about an individual drinking out of a styrofoam and so and everybody

plays men what I’ve talked about earlier you wanted every agency and city

government to be involved in sustainability and so over a period of seven

years you know I always we had no authority we couldn’t order any

department to do anything we had almost no money we had very little money and we

had to work by persuasion by persuading everyone to to work in this area and I

think we didn’t build it into their culture and then in my final year kind of

all the fruits came about you mentioned being certified for lead and you

mentioned being on the a list of top performing cities worldwide in climate and I

was proud that in 2020 we set a very early 2013 we set a very ambitious

greenhouse gas reduction goal for our community to get our missions down

to where they were in 1980 in total not per capita in total by 2020 and we

actually met that goal two years out of schedule we met that goal in 2018 and

almost no other cities were able to do that and that was not me that was the

product of getting everyone on board focusing on scale getting all the agencies

involved to the point where just after I left you know our city council said we

need to be doing a lot more of this we need a lot more money and a much bigger

staff and so they put an issue on the ballot in 2020 that few which

devorites will will tax on their electricity bills which would fund a new

office called the Office of Climate Action Sustainability and Resilience and

that passed overwhelmingly and we went from my office which was funded at

$400,000 a year and had three people to the current Office of Climate Action

Sustainability and Resilience which has over 40 million dollars a year and a

staff of dozens of people so you know I’m pretty pleased with what I did over

seven years seven years is a long time to stay in in a position in city

government and I’m very very grateful that I was able to have this one

opportunity to work in government and also grateful that I’m able to work with

other cities and local governments around the country now because they’re all

different and I’m someone who tries on difference I’m not the kind of person

who can do the same thing every day I want to do something different every day

and that’s what my current company allows me to do but so impressive congrats

and my gosh from 400,000 to 40 million if I’m getting my math correct this is

two orders of magnitude a hundredfold increase what does that mean and just

thinking about numbers for a quick moment in budgets at a municipal level what

does that mean in terms of you know is this now a hundred times greater cost

center or is that 40 million more like an investment in avoiding a whole

bunch of other costs or potential costs when they structured the ballot

initiative they were very careful to indicate that a lot of that money was

supposed to go out into the community was not supposed to fund firing a lot of

new staff and so it was almost structured at least in part as a sort of a

foundation like a newfound new private foundation and so a lot of what the

office does has been to make grants to other entities to do work to do

research to start their own programs to do their own training and so forth but

they also have operational work I mean there’s still you know monitoring

vendors greenhouse gas emissions they have to be updating plans have to come up

with new programs and of course Denver has up two weeks ago when we were

recording this as a new mayor and he’s going to appoint a new head of that

office in fact when I left and they created that office they got rid of the

term chief sustainability officer they called it the executive director of

that office the new mayor is bringing back the term chief sustainability

officer and and that person’s gonna have a lot of money to play with and a lot

of staff to work with I would say it may not be the largest climate and

sustainability fund of any city in the United States because it’s under cities

that are much larger than Denver but I’d be willing to bet on a per capita

per resident basis it’s the best funded climate sustainability program of any

city in the country well yeah it’s really quite interesting in it actually I

would consider it a positive thing to bring back the chief sustainability

officer title to term because one of the the trends and patterns we’re seeing

worldwide is not only among more and more municipal governments but also in

the private sector including with the world’s largest corporations a position

of chief sustainability officer in many of these organizations and institutions

and more and more connectivity it seems among many CSOs out there in order to

you know share information and best practices or equivalent ideas what

I have you and I’m curious and I want to ask a two-part question the first part

is what’s your view on this this global phenomenon and potential for

connectivity and collaboration among CSOs in particular as a certain node

within these organizational ecosystems and secondly tying back to your

earlier comment about your first steps in your professional career what would

you advise to folks these days obviously the world’s a little different who

want to do work in the sustainability regenerative stewardship arenas

regarding any particular courses of study or third-party certifications and

education programs that they might choose to go through experience out to their

resumes etc so it may seem like a bit of a broad question here with these two

parts but in my mind at least it’s got all interconnected let me start the

the second question first about people who are looking to go into this as a

career if you are you’re in luck because sustainability has spread out so far

remember I said earlier I had to wait 10 years to get a job because there were

hardly any that’s not true anymore sustainability is everywhere throughout the

private sector the public sector and so forth and my recommendation which may

make some people unhappy is I don’t actually believe in getting degrees in

sustainability and getting a master’s degree in sustainability or a

certificate in sustainability or anything like that I believe it’s about your
