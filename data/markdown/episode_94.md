Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry, and today

we’re visiting with Tom Chi from At One Ventures. Hey Tom.

Hey there.

How are you doing today?

Pretty good. Just had lunch.

Yeah. That’s great.

Tom Chi has worked in a wide range of roles from astrophysical researcher to fortune 500 consultant

to corporate executive, developing new hardware and software products and services.

He plays a significant role in established projects with global reach, including Microsoft

Outlook, Yahoo Search, and scaled new projects from conception to significance, like Yahoo

Answers from 0 to 90 million users.

Tom has pioneered and practiced a unique approach to rapid prototyping, visioning, and

the leadership that can jump start innovative new ideas, as well as move large organizations

at unprecedented speeds. These approaches have benefited over a dozen industry leading

companies. He most recently served as head of product experience at Google X, developing

technology such as Google Glass and Google’s self-driving cars. His current focus is working

with social and environmental entrepreneurs around the globe, rebooting the fundamental

frameworks of entrepreneurship itself, and coaching and teaching a limited number of values

aligned organizations and leaders.

So Tom, I’m really happy to have this opportunity to visit with you and talk about several of

the projects you’re engaged in and working on. But before we get into kind of the latest

and greatest that you’re engaged with, let me just ask you a bit about your background

and backstory. How did you get into technology in the first place? What first drew you to

the tech arena?

I mean, I started building things from a very young age, so like four or five. So anything

that was around, I guess a lot of people have stories about like, oh, I was very mechanically

inclined. I like to take things apart. I never just took things apart to take them apart.

I was always taking them apart because I could see some other thing you could make with

them. So I started that from quite early and built a bunch of really, I don’t know,

sophisticated for my years kind of things from the very early days. So how did I start?

It’s just, I just started.

Yeah, it’s in your blood, so to speak. You’ve been at it for a while. Let me ask, can

you just describe succinctly what you and your team are doing at one ventures and what

is unique about your approach as a finance vehicle?

Yeah, we’re a venture firm that is focused on helping humanity become a net positive

to nature. So we kind of see the goal of our work and hopefully the goal of the larger

economy over the course of human history is to go kind of create a world where human

presence on the planet makes nature healthier because we’re here as opposed to the crazy

damage that we’re doing right now or just being more efficient around that damage or getting

to some sort of uneasy truth through some level of sustainability. I think we should put

the bar much higher and say, well, if we’re here, then we should really contribute.

And we define nature as air, water, soil, biodiversity. So you got to ask a question, how

could you redesign industry so you build health in those four areas as opposed to death?

And how do you, how do you find this is, you know, either resonating or perhaps you’re

finding resistance with some of the established companies and interests and sectors out there?

Yeah, you shouldn’t worry too much about that. Like, you know, they’re, I’m paraphrasing

Buckminster Fuller a little bit, but he basically said something like, don’t bother fighting

systems, obsolete them. So we’re basically building the, you know, the foundation of the

next economy. And we’re doing it in a way where the unit economics and the environment

economics are superior. So most of the games so far has been better and better unit economics,

but worse and worse environmental costs. And that’s how we have been pushing the economy.

But if you basically say, no, we’re only going to invest in things that have both better

unit economics and better environmental economics, then you start a different kind of trajectory.

Yeah, that’s great. I love that. Bucky Fuller quote, and I’ll track it down and include that in

the show notes because it really is apropos for our discussion today. You know, Tom, you and I met

last summer at a conference at which you were talking about the use of drones to plant trees

to the tune of millions per week in certain regions of the world. And I just want to ask getting

into some of your different technologies and projects, could you summarize for our audience

that particular technology and the impact you’ve already had thus far with it? Yeah. So what I

mostly talked about during that session last year was the planting side of things, but the team

has also been working on monitoring and maintenance as well. And altogether, it represents a radical

reduction in the cost to be able to restore ecosystems. And I know a lot of questions come up,

like we never plant monocultures. We’re always planting a variety of species as recommended by

folks that know that terrain well, whether that be local ecologists, indigenous peoples, that sort

of thing. And we do so in a way where we’ll plant the first stage of ecological succession. And then

after a couple of years, we might come back and plant a follow-on stage of ecological succession

because the most resilient ecosystem is the really healthy, diverse ones. And those are also the

ones that lead to the most permanent carbon storage. Those are also the ones that have the most

co-benefits in terms of their production. So yeah, that’s broadly what the company does. Since we

last heard about the work, the team has continued to improve the tackian is the leading player in

the world in terms of reducing the cost of restoration per hectare. And they started out with, you know,

single-hector tens of hectares type projects. They’ve moved through hundreds of hectares,

thousands of hectares that work on tens of thousands of hectares projects right now. And we’re

bidding on some hundred thousand hectare projects. So we’re going into a pretty interesting restoration

scale. What are you guys finding in terms of success rates with germination of seeds and, you know,

maturation and all of that with the technological approach? Yeah, so the simplest answer is that we do

as well as nature does in the same system. And we’re focused both on the above ground diversity

and below ground diversity. So we’ll sample things like what’s the soil microbiome like, you know,

and what went healthy looked like here. And what’s the mix of, you know, mycelia that you want to have

beneath the soils. And we will go and prep it to both restore above and below. And yeah, I mean,

overall like we’re getting really good traction in terms of the types of quality restoration

that’s coming up. So the folks that we’ve worked with look at the quality of restoration that we’re

doing. And it’s significantly exceeding their expectations. So I’m just say we’re kind of

doing fine on that front. I know that folks want to go narrow it down to like germination rates,

but when you jump into that, it actually gets a lot more complicated because a tropical rainforest

nature, nature planting a seed in that environment might have an ubercent germination rate.

Corial forests might be 15%. And like we do roughly the same as nature in those settings. We’re not

able to plant an aborial setting and get a 90% germination rate, but neither can nature. So like when

the thing spans from 15 to 90%, then if you were like tell me the germination rate, it’s like,

that’s a little too imprecise. Yeah, that makes sense actually. And I’m curious, are you,

is that particular enterprise tapping into the global carbon markets? And is that one of the

finance levers that’s being utilized? So we are not being paid for carbon credits at this moment.

I think that as the business gets into the 100,000 million hectare kind of planting scale,

which is something that will be at within, you know, I’ll say about 12 months, so not too far from

now, then I think we become very interesting in terms of folks that want to play in the carbon

markets because the cost of carbon sequestration per ton via biological sequestration tends to be

very, very cheap compared to technical sequestration. So technical sequestration like

direct air capture or retrofitting a point source emission or smoke stack, you know, that’s kind

of in the 50 to 200 ton, you know, dollars per ton range. Bio sequestration is oftentimes less than

10 dollars a ton and we’re kind of in the range of less than a dollar a ton. So I think from the

pure, you know, cost perspective, we’re very attractive. Now the reason that bio sequestration

hasn’t already taken over the world and the folks, you know, people, you know, are spending a

bunch of time on technical sequestration still is that technical sequestration is good in terms of

additionality. So if I grab stuff out of the air and then put it in the ground, it’s clearly

additional, like, you know, clearly something has moved. It’s good in terms of measureability

because you know exactly how much flow through this pipe or exactly how many kilograms of material

you collected and depending on how you do it, it can be good in terms of permanence of storage.

And bio sequestration depending on the approach can be much weaker on those fronts, but we believe

that using the approach that we’re doing that the additionality will be clear because there’ll be a

lot of places that were degraded ecosystems and after we work on them, there’ll be, you know,

you know, very healthy ecosystems. So that’s clear additionality. We believe that we can get

great measureability because we’ve already been working on the machine-learn algorithms to be

able to go identify species and quantify carbon in the landscape. So I think we’re going to get to

as accurate in terms of the measureability. And then relative to the permanence, it really there,

it’s less about how deep can you vary underground. It’s much more about how robust is that ecosystem?

Is the more robust the ecosystem than the more permanent the storage, basically.

Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So where can folks go to learn more about the tree planting

technology that you’re working with online? Yeah, the trees are the sexy parts. So everybody

wants to talk about the trees, but we do also plant grasses and shrubs in every kind of species

that is supposed to be in that environment and also trees for sure. You can find out about it at

dendra.io, d-e-n-d-r-a.io. Great. Yep. And then I want to ask you also about the choral planting robot

project that you’re working with. I understand that’s in partnership with the National Science

Foundation. Is that right? Yeah, we got an NSF grant to build a choral planting robot. So we

started in June of this year. As of October 8th, we did our first successful pilot test,

and now we’re doing, yeah, where we planted one. Now that said, we planted one, which is not the

rate that we want to be able to go plant at, but the one that we planted, we planted it in less than

15 seconds, and we’re replacing a task that humans take about five to 10 minutes to do.

And we think that, and that wasn’t even fully automated yet, there was like some human in the loop

steering the thing. So we believe that once we do some some basic feed forward automation,

this is even before we get into complex control theory, like we can get the planting time down to

more like three seconds. And that means we’re replacing a five to 10 minute task with three second

task, we’re replacing a task that humans, humid divers need to do with something that a robot can

do. So we can also using manufacturing scale produce a lot of these robots. And the reason I’m

talking about scale in this way is we are, you know, the loss of coral reefs is a major crisis

right now. We are losing, you know, about 1.3 hectares per minute right now globally. And a

hectare is 100 by 100 meters. So you can think about like the biggest coral reef you’ve ever seen,

imagine that disappearing every single minute. Now, of course, it’s not all continuous, it’s across

the whole globe. So it’s a little crusty here, a little thing here, some bad stormers there,

store damage there, bleating them in the summer of so and so. But when you when you average that out

and even it out, then it’s we’re losing them at a rate of 1.3 hectares a minute. And if you look at

the best ways that we know how to restore right now, it takes us about a decade to restore a

hectare. So, you know, if you lose it in a minute and it takes you 10 years to build it back, then

we clearly have a lot of orders of magnitude to get through before we can be anything close to

the rate of loss. So the the whole point of taking a 10 minute task and bringing it down to three

seconds is where you get a couple orders of magnitude there. And then through, so let’s say you get

two two and a half orders of magnitude there and we have about six orders of magnitude to close.

So we’re like a million times too slow with this stuff. You know, you get a hundred

X just in the speed of planting changes. And then you pop into, you know, robotic manufacturing

scale and you you pump out 10,000 of these robots, 1,000 of these robots. And we purposely

designed the robot to be relatively inexpensive. So the one that has done the successful, you know,

pilot run, the total robot right now costs less than, you know, $3,800. And this isn’t compared

in comparison to a lot of marine robotics research platforms. Easily cost half a million,

million, two million dollars, right? So if every one of your robots cost two million dollars,

how many are you really going to put into service? Very few. But if we can get this thing,

if we’re already under 4,000 and we can push the price of this robot down to less than 2,000

or 1,500, then a couple of million dollars goes and funds a lot of this stuff. And all of a sudden,

it’s not that inconceivable for us to put, you know, 10,000 coral planting robots to work

around the world. In that kind of scenario and model, where does the revenue and funding come from?

Or where do you anticipate it will come from as that scales up?

Yeah, I mean, there are some countries that are spending, you know, reasonably aggressively to

be able to try to protect or restore their reefs. So Australia, Thailand, you know, those sorts

of places. You know, there are other places where more at the hospitality scale, you know, like a

hotel chain that is losing their coral reefs and they would love to bring them back because

they’re just direct tourism revenue associated with that. So I do think that there is some

market here, but the reason that this is grant funded as opposed to venture funded right now

is there’s significant market development to be had before you can really

quote unquote capitalize on the market. But the general just here is very similar to, you know,

tree planting or eco-restoration drones where we can we can bring down that that cost of

ecological restoration by a factor of 10, you know, we can go in here and we can bring down the

cost and speed of coral restoration by a factor of 10, 100,000. And that enables a lot of different

avenues in terms of affordability, you know, a rich donor who wants to put in 20 million to go

protect an entire coastline. All that becomes possible if you’re able to go bring down the

effective, you know, economics on it. Yeah, very interesting. I would imagine that one of the other

potential constraints that is being thought about is the farming and production of the baby coral,

right? So as all of technology scaling, you’re going to have to get all these little babies from

somewhere. How does that look and how does that get located around the world? Yeah, so they’re actually

already our coral nurseries and some of them are tied to the pet trade. But, you know, and so some

of that can be put to work, but also I’m an investor in a company called coral vita, which is

basically working on next generation coral nursery. And this includes, you know, like

sexual reproduction and trying to go use some of the best techniques to be able to produce

heat resistant coral through selective breeding. It includes asexual reproduction in terms of

a approach called hyperfagmentation, which is developed by Dave Vaughan from the Million Coral’s

Project that can speed up the growth of hard corals between 20 to 50x. And then some automation

changes to be able to make it so that we’re able to, you know, create industrial scale in terms of

how much we can grow baby corals that would be suitable to bring back into the environment.

Yeah, very interesting. Now, let me ask a question that I imagine, you know, some of our audience

might be wondering. So, you know, here I am thinking about the myriad of this topic science fiction

movies and stories I’ve come across. Do you picture a future where we’ve got drones running around

all over the place flying around and swimming around in the oceans? And what do you say to folks

when they maybe experience a bit of discomfort with that kind of a future vision?

Well, I wish that we already lived in the world that we valued that ecosystem at the level that

we could just have people go out there and do all this work. Yeah, that’d be great.

I would say at least how things have gone so far, it doesn’t seem like that’s the case.

And, you know, look, there’s a lot of folks that are trying to close the gap. They’re like,

well, if we could go quantify ecosystem services and then get insurance companies in on things and,

you know, whatever, the 50 techniques, then that’s basically them trying to go change the economics

to be able to allow humans to get in there and do that work. Because otherwise how you can pay those

humans, but like I kind of, you know, am on the sidelines watching this talk about for 20 years,

and I’m like, doesn’t seem to fully be working yet. Because it’s not like, you know, every year that

we’re around, we’re 10 times better at restoring forests or coral reefs, like we just haven’t gotten

better at it and we’re not doing a great job of it already. So when you’re starting from a

poor baseline, and you’re not getting much better at it as a system as a species, then you’re like,

hmm, we probably need a plan B on this. And air go, let’s go in there and change those

unit economics in a really compelling way and make it so that we can afford to go invest in the

restoration of these ecosystems. Yeah, yeah, I really appreciate that perspective. And I know in some

of our email exchanges leading up to this discussion, I shared with you a concern I have personally

about thinking that, you know, technology’s going to solve everything and that the sort of human

heart and compassion piece is not important. And I was so delighted when you responded back to

a couple of my emails, sharing your perspective on some of those issues that we might consider more

philosophical or ethical in nature. And before continuing on and asking you about a few of these

other amazing technologies, I want to, I want to just, you know, take a kind of pause in the

conversation and ask you about some of these softer aspects of ethics and philosophy and compassion.

And how does that, how does that play into the work you’re doing and into your decision making as

a leader? Yeah, I mean, there’s a lot of places to, you know, answer that question from, you know,

one is that my mom is a Buddhist, so definitely compassion and thinking about the suffering of

beings has been a part of my upbringing. And I see a lot of how we’ve constructed the economy as a

as a systematic, you know, source of suffering for all types of beings, whether it’s the fact that,

you know, 95% of all mammal biomass on the planet is livestock. That’s crazy, right?

More than 70% of all birds on the planet are livestock. That means all of wild birds, you know,

all of wild mammals, all of wild mammals less than 5%. That represents a ton of suffering. And it’s

suffering for everybody. But, you know, another lens on that is the automation lens. Like, I

was part of the leadership team of Google X, so I worked on the self-driving car. Yeah, there’s a bunch of

folks. It’s like, you’re taking away these trucking jobs, you’re taking away these driving jobs. Like,

what are we going to do? And yeah, I mean, I share this story like back in 2013, I got contacted by

the government of Singapore. And I met a delegation of six folks from the government of Singapore.

And they wanted to ask about autonomous vehicles, because they knew it’s a thing that I’d

spent some time on. And we sat down and we were kind of talking. And they gave this amazing

explanation that I will never forget, which is they’re like, okay, so Singapore is like,

we’re a small country and we’re fixed in size. We’re not going to be able to double our, you know,

size. We’re not going to invade some other space and get more land. And you can only build so tall

before it becomes impractical. So we estimate that we can only increase the Singapore population

by X more before it becomes too crowded for folks to be able to, you know, live prosperous lives.

So given that, we can’t continue to grow our GDP via immigration. It means that the only way

that we can become more prosperous as a nation is for everybody in the nation to become more prosperous.

So we’ve done an analysis of all the low-paying jobs in Singapore and the largest

low, you know, the largest cohort of low-paid workers that we have in Singapore are cab drivers.

So, and this is back in 2013. This is before there was any kind of autonomous car available.

But back in 2013, they’re like, okay, so we’ve done this calculation. And because of it, we’ve

already started a retraining program for any cab drivers that would like to kind of up level

their skills into better careers. And as we start to reduce the supply of cab drivers,

we would like to backfill them with autonomous taxi cabs. And I was like,

just that little twist is so huge, right? In the US, it’s like autonomous driving is coming.

You know, everybody get out of the way or a steadiest-time career will destroy you.

And in Singapore, they’re like, no, I mean, we care about the people first.

And if you’re not becoming more prosperous, we don’t want to displace you, right? So let’s

have the demand side of how many autonomous cars we want be a function of how much we’ve been

able to adjust the supply side and how many cab drivers we’ve been able to graduate into other

careers that they prefer. And I was like, that’s such a human way to go approach automation. I

freaking love it. And in the US, we don’t even bring up that type of discussion because we have a

bunch of mythologies that we believe in, which are definitely not true. One is that the invisible

hand is moral where it will lead to moral outcomes. That’s definitely not true. And then the other

thing is that, oh, you know, if technology’s coming, if humans just better get out of the way, like,

no, no, we invent things and we build an economy to, you know, for the purpose of a healthy society,

for the purpose of a healthy environment, that’s what those things should be used for. We shouldn’t

just say, oh, well, sometimes society and environment are sacrificed in the process of making a

successful economy. Like, the society is a super set of economy. Environment is a super set of

economy. Yes. Like, why would you prioritize the subset over the larger thing? We’re blowing

it pretty hardcore on that front. And some of it is, you know, local to the US or the West.

And some of it is, yeah, inside of all of us in the systems that we’ve created.

Yeah, absolutely. I so appreciate what you’re saying. And I will share with you and tell you a

little more offline. I’m working on a writing project in which I take to task a handful of these

mythologies that we see particularly here in the United States that, you know, greed is good and

you know, winner take all and everyone else be damned kind of mythos that really has permeated,

especially in the 20th century as well as the 19th. A lot of the business behaviors and economic

behaviors here in this great nation of ours. And I’ll share more with you about that, Tom.

The subject went to our conversation. But I really appreciate your perspective. And it seems,

you know, with the Singaporean governments doing in that example is not only a great demonstration

of compassion and a humanistic approach, but also means in terms of their economic management

that they’re not introducing or designing for the types of dislocations that we have seen in

this country can lead to really troubling outcomes and consequences. And you know, it’s probably not

lost on many folks that some of the social turmoil that we’re experiencing currently in the United

States is the result of or at least related to some of these dislocations that different sub-sets of

the population have been experiencing as various tech sectors advance and accelerate, right?

Yes. And it’s not even just in the tech sector. It’s the mythology is everywhere.

And we have prioritized economy over society and environment, not understanding that it’s the

subset. If you have an unhealthy society and environment, you cannot have an economy.

Exactly. Yeah, that’s great. Thank you for saying that, Tom. Well, let me ask you now about

iron ox. And all of these technologies, by the way, folks, you can find listed and discussed at

the website at 1ventures.com. So be sure to go there if you want to not only read about these

technologies, but also see images of them. So iron ox really caught my attention. Can you tell us

a bit about that? Yeah, so if you guys are familiar with Dutch Greenhouses, like what the

Netherlands has shown is that a tiny country. So the Netherlands is a tiny country. It’s the

second largest agricultural exporter in the world. And it’s like, well, it’s obviously not because

they have so much land. It’s the super tiny country. But what they have been able to do is they’ve

been able to show really consistent high quality production using greenhouse agriculture.

And what iron ox does is it basically leaps frogs off of that and says, well, what if you also add

robotic automation to that setting as well? And then you end up with a setup where you are able to

go and grow really healthy, really well cared for food, a fraction of the cost of what it currently

costs to grow our food outdoors. And because it’s indoors, you know, in the greenhouse environment,

then you have a lot of control. You’re not as worried about adverse weather events,

which will be a helpful thing too, as the climate continues to destabilize.

So I think that in iron ox approach to things, so it’s basically greenhouse automation,

and we’ll allow us to go address the food security issues of the future. And relative to environment,

there’s an important element as well, which is we use 50% of the habitable land on the planet

to feed ourselves. And you know, things like the destruction of the Amazon, I think there’s a

misunderstanding from like movies in the 90s and stuff that’s like, oh, it’s all these, you know,

timber companies that are coming in and cutting it down. Because I think chainsaws are very

just very cinematic. But in practice, if you look at the numbers, it’s single-digit percentages of the

take of the Amazon comes from timber companies, you know, paper pulp timber. The great majority,

more than 90% of the destruction of the Amazon is to go, they don’t even take the wood, they just

burn it down in order to go plant soybean and graze cattle. And that’s fully food production,

and to the extent that we can do food production in a way that does not require us to just

eat up, you know, because we already ate up 50% of the habitable land surface of the earth for food

production, we can only eat up so much more of that. So like, we kind of need to stop that and

actually roll it back the other direction. And if you’re familiar with, you know, the book Half

Earth, then it basically kind of talks about like, well, if we could set a side half of the earth

for nature, then that would allow us to preserve more than 90% of the historical biodiversity of the planet.

That’s how I so appreciate you sharing some of this information, particularly about the

Amazon, I feel that that’s a really important one for folks to understand more. I want to ask you

also as a follow-up, you know, many of our friends and colleagues are devoting their entire

lives and careers to the regenerative agriculture movement and are doing really important work

in those settings, often in temperate regions. And I’m curious how your commentary and your

vision for technologies like iron ox might fit into a scenario that also includes other aspects of

regenerative agriculture or not, right? I’m curious what you see there looking out into the future.

Yeah, so I think there’s going to be, so I think regenerative agriculture is incredibly important.

I think that there’s going to be an interesting bifurcation, which is I would like there, you know,

for factory farming to be fully replaced and, you know, by cellular agriculture or plant-based

alternatives, I would like for, you know, a bunch of our food production, especially the industrial

food production, to be replaced by things like iron ox. But, you know, look, neither of those things

directly regenerate the soil, but what it does is it alleviates a lot of the ecosystem pressure that we’re creating through these

Extremely, you know, unsustainable ways that we’ve been producing food

And I think relative to you there are the rest of the food that we produce if we can go do that in a way that is

So our regenerative if we can do it in a way that is that brings

You know community together and like that is clearly preferable and and obviously in soil regenerative

You automatically get in their carbon storage and other things that

Well co-benefits like carbon storage co co-benefits like stabilizing, you know local weather patterns, you know, co-benefits

Like you know providing community level resilience. Yeah, so there’s gonna be many settings where that is the case and

You know, I know it’s really tough because everybody especially in a a

You know short attention span world

Once it to be like one answer that we can push forward and love you to answer for everything, but global agriculture is already a

Triforcation, right? So there are there’s one fork of the triforcation

Which are all these folks that are you know in the lower resource nations working, you know less than five acre plots and

Then there is another part of the triforcation, which are these massive, you know, 5,000 10,000 acre plus, you know

Like monocrops that we use for corn soy wheat that kind of thing and

That is almost fully automated anyhow. That’s just a huge tractor and one dude where sometimes it’s it’s an automated system and doing

You know 10,000 acres or more in a monocrop and then the third

Triforcation are the folks that are farmers that are working between like one acre and

2,000 acres that that grow a lot of the food we eat and

What’s funny is that the food we eat we call them specialty crops so like things like artichokes and garlic and whatever things that can’t be ground up into

You know, you know, you know flour or made into corn syrup or whatever we consider that the specialty stuff

But in practice, it’s like that’s actually most of the food we eat in the

In the developed world and the developing world it is the

sub five acre farmers that are doing most of the growing but there’s already a triforcation right now and you got to go think about the

Update to all the forks in the triforcation and I think that gives you a more nuanced understanding of where things can go

Because the triforcation is also not accidental. There are both human and economic factors that make those the the thing that we’ve gone with so far

Yeah, yeah, that that is really great to hear that explained so clearly

Let me

Move on here from iron ox to ask you about true in my print pronouncing that correctly

It’s pronounced true

But it’s it’s not a real word it stands for thermodynamics rules everything around us. Okay

And and what is that? Can you tell us a little bit about that project? Oh

Sure, it’s a company, but yes, what they have done is

PhD from Berkeley

You know another from MIT another from Stanford they got together and they decided to reinvent the air conditioner from the ground up and

Without getting into lots of details the basic thermodynamic design of the air conditioner that we air conditioner some refrigerators that we use today

Was basically finalized in the 1920s, so we have not improved them at all in terms of just basic efficiency

You know, we styled them differently, but like the the heart of the thing is very similar to 1920s tech

So they basically the compressor condenser model or whatever that is right?

Yes, and using refrigerants that boil at a particular temperature in order to go, you know

And and doing that against kind of a carno cycle

So so anyway, that’s all just the standard way that the guts of a refrigerator air conditioner put together

But what TRO is done is they kind of took it from first principles and said well with modern

Approaches and manufacturing in a more modern lens on what we understand today. What can we do and they have been able to put together a

A approach to air conditioning, which is 30 to 50 percent more efficient and therefore costs less to run

but also does not require any fluorine-based refrigerants and

Relative to those refrigerants has 6,000 times less greenhouse gas impact

So for folks that don’t know you should read the book drawdown

That’s one thing because the very first thing in the book drawdown is refrigerants are creating lots of

greenhouse gas emissions and warming and to put it into like a

Maybe a more relatable context

refrigerants which are called F gases another way of you know, it’s a shorthand for fluorine-based gases

That’s what the F stands for

F gases

Have about as much greenhouse gas impact as all of cars combined

So, you know if we could go and redo how we do air conditioning and refrigeration we could make a world where

It’s like we took all the cars off the road and

We especially want to work on this now because as the planet is warming up

Then you’re getting record heat waves in northern Europe and places that didn’t have air conditioning before adding it and

You know, you also have the the middle class in India, you know, being able to afford this stuff now and also

In India, it’s getting also unbearably hot so even folks that are used to a hundred degree heat

It’s clocking in at 125 degrees some days. They’re like no

I mean even with our cultural practices and our you know design for passive cooling and all the different

Things that we do to make you know hot area livable. This is unlivable

So there’s going we we

Estimate that the number of air conditioners in the world is going to double in the next 10 years

And we would like to get ahead of that and not have that be like doubling all the cars on the road

Yeah, absolutely

It’s it’s really fun. Tom going through these different companies and technologies with you and moving right along

I want to ask you about cruise foam and when I saw the image this one really made me smile because I imagine some of our

Friends and audience will really appreciate this one

Yeah, so cruise foam is basically a

replacement to

A type of plastic so styrofoam and polyurethane foam can be replaced with cruise foam and what cruise foam is made out of is

A kite in biopolymer. So it is made from and it can use any source of kite in but the current source of kite in is

Shrimp shells from the from the shrimp aquaculture and

And shrimp fishing industries now what’s so interesting about this foam well

We’re able to go produce this foam cheaper than petrochemical foams

Right, so like part of the reason that plastics have been so hard to displace and they’re literally everything and in everything

Everywhere and in everything is that

The when you think about the cost of anything you can think about it as the cost of the raw materials like the feedstock

And plus the cost of the processing that’s required to transform that raw material into whatever you know

Thing you’d like want to use it for and you add those together. It’s roughly the cost now

The petrochemical industry has had an unfair advantage in that the raw material for plastics is just a residual

Byproduct of you know oil and gas refining and it means that their feedstock cause comes in pretty close to zero and

It means that if you want to go displace

Plastics in terms of costs

You need to you need your feedstock plus processing to be cheaper than just the processing cost on the petrochemical plastics

And cruise foam does fit the bill and we’re basically hunting down

Alternatives for all seven major types of plastic

Because you need to go fight that battle for every type of plastic

Separately, so cruise foam is kind of our cut at that for the styrofoam and polyurethane foam side of things and

The when you go make the stuff out of kite and biopolymer

It is fully marine degradable. It is fully soiled degradable with no technical recycling

So you buried in the ground you throw it in the ocean it becomes ocean and dirt

You know in a month or two

That’s so exciting well very very neat to hear about that and how about tell us about climax foods

Climax foods is basically like the

Rosetta stone to be able to go translate any

Animal-based food that you would like to replace with plant-based replacement

So there’s been a bunch of companies that have like founded themselves on replacing a single product

So impossible burgers like let’s them replace a burger and you know

You know collafia. It’s like let’s replace dairy milk with nut milks and like you know whatever

This is great like let’s replace those things for sure, but what

Impossible foods

Yeah, sorry what climax foods is doing is they have kind of

Created the Rosetta stone so that you are able to go sample any animal this food product

And it’s hour of them will go calculate here’s the recipe of plant-based ingredients that will get you the closest flavor match possible

And they’ve been able to go do that they’re starting with cheeses so they’ve already produced a whole line of cheeses

That I’ve had a chance to taste because I get to go to the

The test kitchen and the cheese cave and all this sort of thing and try these things out and the stuff

Just tastes amazing. I mean it that there’s been taste testers that in our trials who are like

I thought you weren’t going to give me a dairy-based cheese and it’s like we did it

You’re eating the you’re eating the climax foods

You know cheese right now and it just kind of blows their mind

But both in terms of being able to so imagine you know the following problem technically

Imagine there’s thousands of plant-based ingredients that you could combine

Because in the global supply chain there are roughly thousands of ingredients that exist in a large enough supply

relatively easy to source with a co-packer or to you know a do-food work with

So imagine there’s thousands of them and imagine that you know you needed to figure out the exact recipe

That combines like the perfect you know eight of them into something that’s going to taste amazingly close to blue cheese

Or amazingly close to whatever pick your animal-based product that you want to displace

Well, normally that would take you know 10 to 12 months in a test kitchen iterating

Trying trying trying and then you end up with things that are kind of okay you end up with a

A you know plant-based mozzarella, which is mostly just starch

It doesn’t have any of the protein value. Does it but it tastes kind of all right

But what what climax foods

Has been able to do it with exactly the same problem setting is is they can go parse through you know

billions of combinations of those thousands of green ingredients in seconds

And they can go produce a recipe which is a way closer flavor match than what the you know food scientists and these labs are able to do in one they can do it in one day

So it’s just the difference between do you want to take 12 months to make each plant-based product or do you want the recipe today

And then what recipe do you want tomorrow?

So I’m very excited because

I’ve tasted what’s coming out of it and it tastes incredibly close

And they are also able to just tweak a couple other variables

They did one tweak and they were able to go um replicated cheese

But double the amount of protein in it and reduce the price of it by 3x

Yeah, wow and that was just a tweak to the algorithm

It didn’t take more time in a test kitchen

They just said well, let’s make price one of the important variables and not just perfect flavor match

Incredible. Well, let me just ask. Do you have a favorite of the

cheeses that you’ve tasted so far?

I mean I was born in Asia, so I’m no cheese expert, but the the Camembert

the blue cheese

They did like a

good I believe

The stuff is good. I mean, I don’t know what else to say about it. Yeah. That’s great. Well, I mean that really underscores the

advantages of

Rapid prototyping. I mean that is that is you know

orders of magnitude more rapid than the more traditional approach

Yeah, absolutely and of course you still want people to taste it on the other side of it

But like all of the stuff that

That is that slow experimentation process. They’ve collapsed that down by a factor of a hundred

And then you can just get to the tasting and then see what people like

And they have been really um

Getting a good read too in terms of where are

Which sort of flavor compounds there’s more sensitivity and less sensitivity on for some things where it’s like

Oh within this band a factor of three of saltiness this all tastes the same to people

Then there’ll be other parts where it’s like no one percent more of this really changes everything
