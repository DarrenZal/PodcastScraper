Welcome to the YonEarth Communities Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast Series.

Today I am so delighted that we have visiting with us Osha Chestnut-Perry.

Hi Osha.

Oh, thank you for having me.

It’s great to have you on the show.

So Osha was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado and graduated from Boulder High School

after which she moved to St. Louis to get a well-being coach certification.

She also has worked as a medical assistant at an integrative clinic there in St. Louis

for a year and is also studying at St. Louis University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in

neuroscience with a premed emphasis.

Now at that same clinic, she’s working as a cryotherapy technician and helping folks

with their holistic health and well-being through that clinic’s integrated work.

Osha is passionate about cooking, the outdoors, dancing, animals, the brain and her family.

Now that’s a very special note because I have to also share with our audience some

of whom already know this, many of whom probably don’t.

I invited Osha to be on the show because I happened to know she is a particularly bright

and gifted young lady.

In fact I know this and knew this when she was two years old and by that time had already

learned to identify around 20 or so of the medicinal plants and herbs that grow in the Rocky

Mountain Wilderness here in Colorado.

The reason I know that of course is because Osha is my daughter and it is such a joy

Osha to have you on the show and to be able to share with folks a number of threads and

conversations you and I have been having for quite some time now.

So before we dive in I just want to say welcome and thanks for being here.

Thanks dad, it’s great to be here and I’m happy to do this with you.

Wonderful.

So we’re going to talk today about healthcare, education, food and nutrition and I’m wondering

what with your studies with what you’re doing professionally, you have a very interesting

perspective on our healthcare system in this country.

What does it look like to you from your vantage point?

Yeah so in the United States healthcare looks a little bit different than it does in a lot

of other developed countries.

Obviously it’s not universal.

There isn’t, you know, there’s no backing by the government to ensure that everyone

has free or affordable healthcare.

So that looks a lot different from a lot of countries in let’s say Europe.

So already that is kind of an issue and I think one that most people are pretty well aware

of but you know even taking a broader look at medicine, something that I think people

aren’t aware of is that the training to be a medical practitioner is actually pretty

harsh.

So that kind of sets the stage for what medicine looks like and what healthcare looks like

in this country because our practitioners don’t know how to take care of themselves physically

or don’t have the structures set up to live a well in balance lifestyle and they’re the

ones that are giving us advice on health and wellness, you know.

So that’s kind of my view and you know there’s definitely a change happening as well I

would say.

A lot of people are becoming aware of this especially people in the industry and there are people

trying to make a change of that like where I work.

We have a lot of functional medicine practitioners which is for those people that don’t know what

functional medicine is.

So look at the whole being and the whole person instead of just an organ system or you know

a symptom less and so they’re going to go and look at the root cause of a disease maybe

it’s actually from your birth maybe it was a little bit of a traumatic birth maybe it

was something that you grew up in you know in your childhood in your adolescence maybe

you were exposed to heavy metals maybe you lived in a really polluted place you know

maybe you just didn’t have the best diet they’re going to look at all of those things to

see okay if you have diabetes one was it on set why did it why did it appear then versus

10 years earlier 10 years later and then kind of really holding your hand through that

to through changing your life and changing the way you live to support that illness and

to make some epigenetic changes and you can see what those practitioners they themselves

are living that as well and so for me it’s very helpful to be surrounded by those kinds

of practitioners and it really is a change in the culture and it’s not just happening

in St. Lawrence it’s happening all over the country and I think that’s pretty exciting.

It’s so great so I want to come back to a few terms that you just mentioned such as epigenetics

however you know one of the things with the work we’re doing through the Wioners community

is is really balancing information with inspiration with things we can do in our own lives our

own communities to improve health well-being thriving and of course stewardship and sustainability

and I’m just wondering so when you when you all are working with patients and you’re seeing perhaps

issues related to exposure to pollutants or diet over years etc. What are the what are the

categories are the the lists of recommendations you make to folks to help them get on the track

of improved health and well-being so at the clinic I work there’s a lot of integrative therapies

that would be recommended um from kind of my perspective and just your average person that maybe

doesn’t have access to those things it really comes down to inflammation and toxicity so

toxicity or inflammation is basically the two roots of any illness or disease and so it’s important

to address both of those things um you know we’ve known this since

Hippocrates and sclepias in Greece that food is not medicine right so a lot of diet is it’s

going to be key to addressing those two things so if we think about toxicity um you know like when

you’re buying conventionally grown things or produce that’s you know made with a lot of pesticides

or even a lot of processed foods that have additives in them that’s going to increase your toxic

burden and that’s not something scary because we actually have these systems in our body that are

built to filter those toxicities and you know we’re very resilient just in our body aspect we’re

very resilient creatures um but there does it’s like a buffer system right so there’s it reaches

a certain threshold and then you start to see some symptoms and so it’s really important

to be mindful of what you’re subjecting your body to whether it be you know putting yourself

in a situation where you’re around a lot of smoke or a lot of air pollution um trying to get out

you know you’re some trees to where you’re in an environment but it’s a little bit more filtered

being mindful about the food that you put in your body you know it is a grown locally

is it in season is it kind of agreeing with the rest of the experience that your body is having

is it grown naturally is it fresh all those kinds of things and then are you cooking up

properly so at the right temperature um ensuring that you aren’t cooking up all the nutrients

etc and then on the inflammation piece um a lot of that actually has to do with stress so

really limiting your stress um kind of taking up you know more mindful practices

so letting yourself experience violence every day um again getting outside you know exposing

yourself to the fresh air to the sunshine kind of allowing your nervous system to calm down

every day because even driving in a car is a natural for our nervous system it’s something

that was invented you know a hundred and what 50 years ago or something like that and um

less I don’t know a little less but more more yeah more than a hundred years ago about

sure since you go yeah okay um and so it’s that’s not enough time for your nervous system to

catch up to that and so even something as simple as driving in a car is going to cause stress

and so it’s just important to be mindful of this and to limit those things when possible

and to supplement with other um detressing practices it’s so beautiful what I love about

the framework that you’re describing is it’s relatively simple and straightforward and easy

to understand inflammation and toxicity um excellent right it’s I can think of so many ways

that we know folks can reduce stress and can reduce toxicity and can reduce inflammation

and one of the things I’m thinking about right now is uh our ambassadors are planning to have

events a little later this year where we will plant a whole bunch of baby spider plants

folks are probably familiar with spider plants yeah put inside your home your bedroom perhaps

your office and we know that indoor air quality as we increasingly urbanize uh is essentially

one of the ways more and more of us are being exposed to toxicity in certain plants uh spider

plants in particular have been shown to be amazing air filterers essentially I I know a study that

I looked at for the uh writing of YonEarth showed that within five minutes

in controlled environments a spider plant was shown to measurably reduce uh airborne carcinogens

and what a what a wonderful simple kind of thing we can all be doing get some spider plants

into our homes and do our offices they’re relatively easy to care for okay um there there are so

many other uh examples of course you mentioned getting out with trees and there’s I’ve seen a lot

of research coming out about how uh literally five or even ten minutes uh being surrounded by

and looking at living trees will measurably reduce stress hormones in our bodies okay fabulous like

we have um cities we have some access to to parks and uh forest preserves and so forth so I just

I’m absolutely how hopeful all of this can be for us yeah absolutely and uh kind of to pay back

on that I was reading an article recently about the amygdala and being in nature um so the amygdala

among other things controls our fear response and um I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie um

what is it called presolo about the man who presoloed El Capitan so one of the reasons he was able

to do this is because his amygdala is actually physically smaller than the average person and so

he doesn’t experience the same fear response in those dangerous situations that most of us do

allowing him to persevere through that situation when most of us would be frozen with fear um

but something that being in nature does is actually a kind of tempers this fear response

and so it’s inevitable that it’s going to be triggered at some point in your day just because

you know things happen but if you’re able to then calm it down every day as well it’s just again

going to promote kind of a little bit more harmony and you know just the brain which is the great

yeah it seems really interesting you know in so many of our interactions socially and in clubs

at work organizations we may belong to uh there can often be exchanges that trigger essentially the

the fighter flight um mechanisms and in that you know often interferes with our ability to

communicate with one another to maintain compassion open hearts and it strikes me that

one of our biggest practices when even when we’re thinking about global issues of stewardship

and sustainability have to do with the cultivation of our own neuro biochemistry and really kind of

training or developing some discipline around um changing habits in terms of responding to

different stimuli different situations and I know you’re in deep studying this sort of thing and

I’m wondering if um you might have a lot of works and and perhaps even you know tied a bit to the

epigenetics it could be some of our our audience aren’t as familiar with that term epigenetics

maybe you could stand on that a bit sure um so epigenetics basically is when your

environment physically changes your genetics so we all have a DNA strand that we’re given from birth

and um certain proteins are going to be expressed or not expressed depending upon the environment

so it’s not that your genetic basis is changing at all but let’s say you know um you have

a i’m not even sure this is true this is just going to be an example let’s say if you are eating

an only sugar diet um it’s gonna you’re gonna have a lot more carbohydrates to break down and

let’s like proteins are fast and so the proteins that are required to break down the carbohydrates

will need to be up-regulated or um the genetic sequence that is made for that protein

is going to be expressed more and then the proteins that would be expressed for breaking down

proteins are fast the enzymes that would be expressed for breaking down proteins are fast

would need to be down-regulated and this is just to conserve energy and this is happening all

the time in the body um for different things from you know dealing with temperature fluxes in

your body and around your body um to stress to sleep to caffeine to all of these different things

so your body is a very dynamic system it’s constantly changing depending on what kind of

environment you put it in and expose it to um so that’s kind of what epigenetics

you’re born with a predisposition for x, y, and z disease that doesn’t necessarily mean

that you are going to get x, y, and z disease it just means that if given the right environment

you could develop it but that also means that if you give it the right environment you may not

all develop any symptoms and you may live a very healthy life now this is a very um new discovery

in the greater scheme of things and so the science isn’t there yet to say okay we know how to

prevent cancer for you by just giving you the right environment but we are headed in that

direction um to where I think we will be able to use our genetic sequence to be able to live a

life um more or less to the benefit of ourself based on what our genetics are but like I said

that’s a lot’s a long time coming that’s probably not in my lifetime more my if I have children

or grandchildren it’s probably ways out um but in terms of stress responses in like our everyday

life when that fight or flight response is triggered there are certain things that we can do

just to lower our cortisol and some of those other chemicals um that circulate in our blood

stream to you know make us excited enough to fight our flight basically um so

something that I found really interesting is that our heart is really sensitive um electro

magnetically and so there actually is about a nine foot or three meter um radius around your

heart that your heart can detect electromagnetic differences so if you think about that night

be there’s a pretty far way away so when you’re in a crowd you could be interacting with 12 other

people’s you know electromagnetic pulses from their heart right and so if you’re in a crowd and

everyone is experiencing fear even if you’re thinking I’m not going to experience this your body

is still registering that fact and is having a response to some effect on the contrary

if everyone is experiencing fear and you are aware of that and can calm down your heart then that

calm is also being emitted to the people around you and that can have an effect as well um so

something that the heart mat institute has kind of shown and developed is that but also is

showing that deep breathing and diaphragm breathing has shown to decrease this kind of fear

response in your heart and um help other people around you then also become more calm more hopeful

even in stressful situations and so deep breathing diaphragmatic breathing is really deeply important

to combating stress in your everyday life this is so exciting so I have to give a quick shout out to

one of our ambassadors John Parcell who works with heart math and is helping get to get

more of the heart math technology and techniques into various healthcare hospitals

corporation schools etc so this is so exciting and I’m so struck one of the things I’ve been

experimenting with the last year or two is when standing in line at the grocery store especially

around rush hour toward the end of the day when people seem to be really stressed in the

store tends to be a bit busier uh all often uh just be there in line without you know being

conspicuous about it but I’ll work on essentially cultivating calm and love and joy and gratitude

and kind of feel like I’m maybe uh sharing that outward and I didn’t realize the mechanism uh

until you describe it this way it’s what an amazing gift what an amazing tool that we each have

with us each and every day and my gosh how much could we positively change our world as

thousands and millions of us work to cultivate this kind of uh ethos through through that

how how do we know about this like what instruments have allowed us to understand

this electromagnetic property of the heart that was a great question I don’t know that much about

the research yeah I would assume it has to do with I mean my assumption would be maybe electromagnetic

probes in two different humans and then giving a few response in one having it them in you know

physical proximity and seeing if there’s a response in another yeah but I wouldn’t know for sure

and not to get too far afield you know contented um we make some uh guests on the show

in the near future who have been working with ways to demonstrate that plants may actually be

interacting with this same sort of electromagnetic radiation and that there’s some

interactivity there that uh some folks are working on there’s been research going back at least

to the 70s on this but it sounds like in the last decade or so things are really progressing in our

scientific understanding of of what’s going on in this incredible place we call Earth

absolutely and I think two part of that has to do with um a change in the scientific community

so not to say that the research from the 70s wasn’t great research but the scientific

community didn’t accept it because it seemed you know outlandish or just almost like sci-fi or

new ag or whatever you want to call it you know but um a lot I think it’s kind of like the

straw that broke the camel’s back with there are enough people that are credible that are showing

this research and so you know the scientific community can’t help but to recognize it now

which is great it’s so exciting yeah you know I know that some of our um our clock works

that allowed us to mechanically show the complex motions of of the planets in our solar system and so

probably informed what became a quite mechanistic way of understanding all of reality and

and with when it comes to biology when it comes to living uh creatures like you like me like all

our friends and family like plants like animals um it seems that the the mechanistic

paradigm is really insufficient in in many ways to to understanding uh what’s happening in those

extraordinarily complex systems yeah absolutely it’s a reductionistic view which

you know when you’re a small child you have to reduce things in order to wrap your head around it

and we’ve done basically infants for all of human history you know like just now maybe we’re

becoming toddlers maybe but they’re still we just we don’t have the capacity to fully understand

a lot of the things in our universe and so we have to take a reductionistic view in order to try and

make prediction to try and understand some mechanism but at the end of the day like we still do not

have a full picture and it’s incredibly important to remember that when you’re doing research when

you’re um learning and to be constantly fighting to push that reductionism kind of out of your head

and to look at the big picture and to take into account account all of the pieces yeah yeah yeah

you know i’m difficult i’m struck that um uh interacting with some of my friends who are either

traditionally trained as scientists or ten toward a quote unquote scientific world view

and so often i think the um categorical mistake it’s made that uh to be able to prove something

with certainty within the scientific paradigm um versus understanding that there’s so much to truth

into reality that is that our science our our instrumentation our experimental frameworks are

simply not sophisticated enough yet to get into that realm of proving or disproving and it

creates a really challenging epistemological framework what do we know what don’t we know etc

and i often see folks who have scrubbed to the scientific uh you know paradigm if you will

getting tripped up around that mm-hmm yeah absolutely yeah i think there’s much growth to be done

i think it will be done and just you know we’ve been around for 120 000 years and i’ve only gotten

here so i’ll take time yeah so i want to ask a little more about what we can do for for inflammation

this is such a big deal on it seems more and more people’s minds and uh i know of course a lot of

sugar can cause inflammation i i know more and more folks who are taking turmeric and ginger

uh to help reduce inflammation stuff we find traditionally in the drink called chai um

so what else what else can we be doing to to regulate inflammation um well a lot of it has to

do with the gut so ensuring that the gut is healthy taking probiotics um you know seeing your

provider to ensure that you don’t have something like cevo which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

which actually a lot of people suffer from or something like ibs would be kind of the result of

an imbalance to gut so really looking at the gut and making sure everything is in balance and

working with practitioner for that but on a more personal level um putting alcohol as much as

possible really limiting you know your red meat your corn your dairy your gluten unfortunately i

know all the things we love um yeah your sugar um eggs can even be a little bit inflammatory depending

upon your system but it also i mean the best advice i’ve ever gotten and my best advice i think i

could ever give someone in terms of nutrition and taking care of the body is listen to your own

body so pay attention if you’re getting bloated pay attention if you’re feeling fatigued if you

are getting sick a lot um if you have allergies all of these are are kind of signs that you are

having some inflammation in your body and you can start to kind of pinpoint okay when i eat corn

i feel x y and z so then avoid corn for a month and see if you feel better and if it’s not that

then maybe try eliminating something else that you pinpoint you know and have fun with an

experiment with yourself like life is joyful and how much fun is it to get to know yourself and

get to know how your body works you know um but even beyond that cryotherapy which is something

that i do for my job right now is great for inflammation reduction um and that is something

that’s popping up kind of all over the us right now so that’s great if you can you know find one of

those so explain what is wrong getting enough sleep yeah so yeah cryotherapy because i imagine

some of our audience may not be familiar with that term yeah so cryotherapy is a treatment

where you get into a chamber that is cooled with liquid nitrogen and we know liquid nitrogen is

very very cold it actually can’t exist as liquid in normal condition so it turns into a gas as

soon as you know it comes into contact with you or even comes into proximity with you so you’re

in a session for up to three minutes and it gets to you know you really want to be around well

at least colder the negative 60 degrees Celsius once you hit that negative 60 degrees Celsius

marks then you’re going to get to see the benefits that are promised from cryotherapy

but some of the machines like the one that i work with gets to what is it negative 120 degrees

Celsius which is about negative 180 Fahrenheit if i’m not mistaken wow that’s really cold

that’s pretty cold yeah but it’s only three minutes totally dual

so um you just mentioned sleep and i you know i’ve thought one of the things i really enjoy

about getting older that as your dad i have the opportunity to speak to you from time to time is

that just from my own experience i’m able to know ahead of time oh if i today if i

sense and this is about listening to body oh i probably need some avocado or i probably need an

extra large keeping salad of organic greens and i actually know i will feel a good way the following day

and certain certain um uh super foods do this for me blueberries are one of my favorites that i

enjoy here and there and uh to be able to get to that place in life where where we kind of know

that about ourselves is such a joy and such a delight and for me sleep is is one that’s just huge

and i know that um sleep deprivation uh and or uh insufficient sleep is is a major issue for a

whole lot of us in this country and society um but it seems that this is one of the really big

top priority items what what do you tell your patients when it comes to sleep

well i don’t really talk to them about sleep just because that’s not like i don’t have kind of

the qualification to speak to that um but you know something that i’ve overheard and that i would

tell my loved ones is um obviously to prioritize sleep and i actually one of my favorite books

that i’ve ever read and something that got me really interested in neuroscience is um i want to say

i think it may be called sleep and i forget who it’s written by but i can get you that information

if you want to put it in something and um it basically outlines i think 10 steps to getting a good

night’s sleep so um and kind of resetting your circadian rhythms one of you know just off the top

of my head i think it lists turning off anything that emits blue light one to two hours before you go

to bed um actually when you get up in the morning you’re taking a walk is really important

and it’s even better if you can take a walk outside and see natural sunlight

the taking a walk actually warms up your brain so your brain is about three to five degrees cooler

than the rest of your body while you sleep and so in the morning it’s not live it’s literally not

warmed up so um it’s great to take just even a 15 minute walk to get kind of the juices flowing

and to warm up your brain so that it knows okay it’s time to be awake um seeing the sunlight

really helps with your hormones system and resetting that circadian rhythm and all of the sleep

hormone cycles of the day um excuse me you know having a nighttime care routine is really important

so even if it’s just brushing your teeth for the same amount of time every day in the same place

that tells your brain it’s time to go to sleep it’s time to begin winding down um and that again

is going to help with your sleeping i’ve learned that i love sleeping with a sleep mask actually thank

you to my wonderful grandmother your mom uh she got me a silk sleep mask for Christmas and now um

if i wake up in the middle of the night or have trouble sleeping all i have to do is put on my sleep

mask and i’m not particularly sensitive to light but the fact that it puts pressure on my eyes

calms my entire nervous system and so that’s something for me that i found is like

better than taking sleep medication and it’s it’s amazing you know and so finding little things

like that can really help with your sleep um magnesium is great for your sleep so a lot of

the reason um behind of why magnesium works is actually magnesium is a critical element in um

the hormones that are necessary for sleep and magnesium is something that is also used in

stressful situations by your body so most of us are actually magnesium deficient um and so taking

magnesium right before you go to bed just a low dose is great for making sure that your body

can produce those hormones to allow you to fall asleep and stay asleep and it shouldn’t make you

feel groggy in the morning because it’s just you know these normal chemicals that your body is

making you’re just giving it the building blocks yeah sometimes use a little uh powdered magnesium

in my water when i’m getting ready to get to go to sleep and yeah that’s great there’s certain

music i like to listen to that i’ve been listening to since high school actually that

is those uh signolars that you’re describing that tells great embody oh it’s time to go to sleep

we know this totally yeah yeah exactly um something else started that i just thought of as exercise

is really important for the regulation of your hormones but um exercising too late can also

interrupt your sleep so exercising earlier in the day is great for maintaining a good sleep cycle as

well that’s so wonderful and don’t eat too late either all these little things keep dropping into

my head yeah yeah well let me mention uh for our audience that this is the YonEarth communities

stewardship and sustainability podcast series today we are speaking with my daughter osha

Chestnutt-Perry and uh i want to be sure to give a shout out to our sponsors which include

wheylay waters of course a hot bath can be in some aroma therapy can be very helpful for sleep

so wheylay waters purium the brad and lindsey lidge foundation

earthcoast productions the international society of sustainability professionals

the association of walder schools of north america and i want to also give a special shout out to

uh both patagonia and equal exchange for their recent support of our leadership summit massively

mobilizing sustainability also we have a new monthly giving program and i’m so excited we’re

already seeing a beautiful response to this and for you enjoying the podcast uh you can

become a monthly supporter at any level uh that works for you by going to wheyanarth.org slash

support of course please like and share and follow with twitter and facebook and the social media

out there um and a special giveaway for our audience you can use the code mobilize uh to get free

downloads of our ebook and audio book resources and please share this with your friends and family

we uh are already seeing downloads in over two dozen countries every continent not counting

Antarctica yet but all the other continents so this is a great way to help get our stewardship

sustainability and thriving information out there and um osha i’m so thrilled i often take notes

when i’m uh having these podcast discussions and my paper is just about filled up i don’t know

if you can see it so that’s great it’s just wonderful to be able to speak with you and connect

so many dots with you and i’m sure that many of our audience are going to really appreciate this

episode with the specific things we can be doing in our own lives and i’m just i’m wondering

you know before we wrap up in the next few minutes um what else from your perspective

with your studies in uh neuroscience your your studies and work in the the health and wellness

uh arenas what else from your perspective has you excited what what are you saying gosh i wish

millions of more people knew about this what would you what would you share with with the

world about uh about your view on things yeah um so i might not get a little bit more personal

then because this is something that i think has really just been an aha moment for me

it’s not research based although i’m sure there is actually a bunch of research out there to back

me up on this um but really the one thing that i think everyone should become aware of is

the physical and emotional effects positive effects of living with more of a humanitarian and

you know kind of loving and kind attitude every day of your life can have so i think

something for me that i’ve really been working on these past several years is just being kind

to people and you know waking up every morning and thinking what can i do for humanity today and how

can i you know lift some of the heaviness of the world today and live a little bit later and this

is something internally that i have to work on you know i’m working on my heavy emotions my heavy

thoughts um and then also more externally so not getting frustrated when traffic is bad and i’m

running late for something or um when you know it’s just been a hard day and everything’s a little

chaotic taking into breath and reminding myself that if i’m feeling this way probably other people

are feeling this way too and so something i can do about that is to just be extra kind and

smile to a stranger you know tell someone they look beautiful tell someone that i really enjoy

speaking with them or i enjoy their thoughts um and yeah just like really trying to live with love

in your heart every single day and i think something that i would like to say to everyone that’s

viewing today if you have children or young people in your life i think something that is

fundamentally important to our future is teaching them that the most valuable thing that they can

do with their lives is dedicate it to something greater than themselves and dedicate it to other people

and that can look like a lot of different things that might be having children and bringing them

up in a home of love that might be being a chef and cooking great food for people that might be

being a farmer and growing good food for people um it might even you know be in these things that

we think are harsh climates that could be in advertising and choosing to take the jobs

that are promoting sustainable products you know it could be in politics and really fighting

for these issues that aren’t so popular um and you know everything that you can do you can do

in a way that serves humanity or you can do it in a way that doesn’t and so i would just say to

everyone like really think about how you’re living your life and how you can do it to support your

fellow humans your fellow animals your fellow plants your your world your home

that’s it that is so beautiful oh yeah well i learned from the best

well i love you tremendously and you bring great joy to me and i’m extraordinarily proud of you

and it is such a good joy to be able to share a a a taste of the exquisite conversations

you and i have with our audience and i’m just grateful we’ve been able to have this conversation
