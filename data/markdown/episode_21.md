Hi friends, welcome to today’s episode of the Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast

series brought to you by the YonEarth Сommunity.

My name is Aaron Perry and I’m here today with Chef Maria Cooper, I’m Maria.

And I’m so excited that we get to talk today with you about food, nutrition, different

cultural inspirations and even familial inspirations behind food.

And some of you who may know me know that food is one of my very favorite and dear passions

and I like to say eating is one of my favorite sports.

And some of you may also know Chef Maria Cooper is the executive chef at the Highland City

Club in Boulder, Colorado where we have many meetings, discussions, book club discussions

and a variety of authors and thought leaders, impact entrepreneurs and others from the community

come together and share ideas and time together, often eating Maria’s amazing magical food.

And of course we talk in YonEarth that food is so central to our cultivation of relationships

and to our connection with soil and planet and people all over the world.

And it’s with that in mind, Maria, I’m so grateful we get to have this discussion with you today

and thank you so much for joining us.

Thank you.

And Maria is the author of Heartful Kitchen, a wonderful cookbook that has amazing features

in it, resources for folks that we’ll be talking about and I highly encourage you all to check that out

at chef Maria Cooper.com and so Maria I want to ask obviously I’ve been nourished by your cooking

for many years now here in the community and it’s one of my most favorite treats in part of the week

when I get to eat a meal that you create and give us what’s the background?

What’s the story behind how you’re now nourishing so many people with food?

Well, Aaron, it’s been a pleasure to get to know you and feed you for a while now.

And I do love cooking at the City Club, it’s been a pleasure, I’ve been cooking there for about eight and a half years

and prior to that I did some personal chef work and some catering and I’ve often been drawn to people with special diets

special diet needs gluten-free, dairy-free and those folks who are even needing even more particular care with their food

such as autoimmune protocols diet, fog map, scaps diet, things like that and people come through at City Club sometimes

and have very particular needs with food and so over the years I have been interested in putting together recipes

that are incredibly clean and low in flammatory and all of that and in fact for myself and my own diet I’ve had to do that

and so about it’s been, let’s see, maybe five or six years ago I got sick with I found out that I had a few different autoimmune issues

and I had to get really clean with food, ridiculously clean, like no gluten, no dairy, no grains, no fruits

had an issue with insulin, I couldn’t have any sugar, any kind and at the time I was living a very busy life

teaching dance, my partner has a son so there’s a lot going on

and full-time job and so I was trying to make it work in my own home and I was having to find ways of cooking really simply

but stopping the fridge and thinking in advance and wanting to only cook a few nights a week

and so I created a bit of a system at home and I was inspired to start to write things down

and friends and family for years have been asking me to give them recipes as well

and so it started culminating into this idea of writing a book and this was about five years ago

so anyways that was the start of what is heartful kitchen today but it’s been a five-year project

and a lot of different inspirations that being one the the diet piece of it

another piece you mentioned the the familial piece and so my my grandmother who’s probably my

number one biggest food inspiration she’s a hundred years old now

Lebanese grandmother and when I was growing up I would spend weeks during the summer with her

and we would cook Lebanese food together and so I definitely fell in love with food at a very

young age and and it was just a blast spending time with her and being very slow with food

and getting my hands into lamb and you know flavoring it up with lemon and garlic and parsley

and tasting the raw lamb before we rolled it up into into balls and doing you know everything

we did with it putting it into pastry and putting it into the oven and it was just really

special times so many inspirations she wrote a cookbook and I it’s not published but that is a

that is a goal of mine to to get that to press at some point and the publishing company this is

a self-published book and I have created a publishing company called Mary Rose Press and her name

is Mary and her middle name is Rose so that is after her and so you can obviously publish her book

through that press yeah I hope to do so that is so wonderful I my connection with with food is

very closely tied to my time with my grandmother in the kitchen as well and she was Slovenian

and so we had this incredible connection to old ethnic recipes and traditions and what

what a joy to have that that direct thread and for you to be carrying that forward and sharing

that now with so many people the way that you are and one of the things I’m struck by and you

are of course a bit of a celebrity here in the community with your food so many folks just

absolutely rave about the meals you create and one of the things that strikes me as incredibly

precious in there is that these are delicious flavor bursting experiences that are also so

nutritious and so nourishing for for us and it’s it’s clear when you’re

dishing out for people one by one there’s so much love in what you’re doing and I imagine

that it has something to do with the relationship with your grandmother and where you’re coming from

when you’re preparing food for people yeah and my mom too you know when I am the youngest and

I think busyness was like a thread in my family growing up goes with my grandmother and my mom

but what by the time I was I don’t know exactly I want to say 10 or 11 my my mom

went back to grad school and so she was quite busy but when my my older siblings were

were young she was at home and so I just have memories of her being so full so busy but she would

she would somehow make space to come home and prepare these amazing dinners every night

and my mom is a fantastic cook like the best like when I when I go home every time I go home it’s like

it’s like it’s the best food I’ve ever had you know so you know simple simple things like

she makes fish better than anybody so there’s a recipe in the book called a babe’s baked fish and my

mom’s my mom’s name is Linda but everyone calls her babe in her family and so this dish is

generally made with cod but you can make it with with any any white fish really and it has pistachio and

citrus zest and I make it with ghee because I I think he’s a very tasty healthy fat to cook with

which you can do it with coconut oil or chicken fat or another healthy fat and it’s so easy you

just put everything in a casserole and stick it in the oven and bring it out and base it with the

fat and the lemon juice and so she had this way of creating dishes that were very simple and very

healthy and incredibly delicious so yeah it was my grandmother in the summers or when we would go

see her but throughout life my mom definitely nourished us like through the busyness and and that’s

what I’m trying to do with this book you know is is remind people that you know it’s not so bad to be

busy like we are going to be busy we’re getting busier it seems with our cell phones and our iPads

and everything that we’re multitasking doing but it’s so important to continue to nourish ourselves

and frankly we’re not nourishing ourselves when we go out to eat so often even when we go to

you know the whole paycheck grocery store and choose to have dinner there over and over like

we think we’re nourishing ourselves but when we do it so often it’s um we’re not choosing the

healthiest oils to put into our bodies and to to make choices at home we’re saving time we’re saving

money we can eat organic vegetables at prices that aren’t exordated and um and it’s important

to look at the facts that we are we’re cooking with and so there’s lots of tools in the book

that talk about this not to come from trying to be a perfectionist about food because that’s not

what it’s about it’s about relaxing around food really but having all the information of how can we

eat a nutrient death diet um you know i think a lot of folks are are eating a more of like an empty

calorie diet um and because it’s quick it’s quick to choose um more of a carb rich diet

and it’s fun but um but when we’re choosing foods like um you know hearty vegetables

color rich vegetables and organic proteins um we’re choosing nutrients and the calories that

we’re eating have more vitamins and then almost in them so there was um there’s a a toolbar

at the bottom of each recipe in the book and right now the toolbar relates to uh healing diets

that particular doctors recommend for for patients and some some examples of these diets are

our um fod maps and gaps diet and autoimmune protocol plant paradox um originally when i created

this this healing diet toolbar was going to include vitamins and minerals so let’s say for example

this lemon zested garlicky broccoli yeah i just i just opened to this and it’s a beautiful image

so i i think i’ve probably eaten this before and uh i assure you it’s delicious so yeah i see at the

bottom there is this um health food bar right in the guide so what what do these

yeah so so let’s say you follow a fod map’s diet um what is that by the way i’m not

looking familiar yeah so certain certain diets that i have in this book let’s say so so a good friend

of mine um david to sack who works in the building uh that i that i work in the highland building um david

helped me some with this project and um brilliant man brilliant doctor part of he started called

medical and um so david inspired me to create this this medical toolbar and um so fod map’s diet

is a is a diet that he might recommend to a patient who potentially is struggling with a gastrointestinal

issue and to test whose test shows up in a way that says okay this this is indicated that this

person might need to follow this diet and so for the broccoli dish um if you’re following the

fod maps diet cruciferous vegetables are in no okay so this means that we know go yeah yeah so um

but then we have plant paradox yeah and then you can have it if you’re plant paradox i’m not

i’m not going to take the time here to go through all of this but um but if you follow these diets

this book if you follow one of these diets this book will be helpful um in giving you guidance

around each recipe uh huh that’s incredible it’s such a resource yeah it’s a resource in that way

and it could be a resource for um for uh healing healing doctors in that way as well so so i was

saying a moment ago i was uh considering having vitamins and minerals on this as well and as i

started to look through there’s just way too many um like in every recipe there’s there’s so much

and it’s almost just like what’s the point um because every recipe um is very mineral rich

vitamin rich so um yeah it does you it does a good service to to um to look at um

vitamin and mineral rich foods as much as you can nutrient dense foods and a book like this can help

yeah so my my takeaway uh sort of reiterating this for our audience is that we don’t each need to

become the expert that you are and and you with access to other experts like medical doctors we

can get the book and use it as a guide through our own uh healing journeys our own quality of life

improvement journeys whether it’s having an issue with gluten or dairy or other inflammatory

other uh potential conditions this is a resource any number of us can use and and get wonderful

results right and you know you you know that when using these recipes um you are

taxing the body as little as possible there’s no night shades in this book as well um night shades are

for those of you don’t know vegetables that grow at night potatoes um eggplant peppers tomatoes

um so yeah night shade free grains free there’s no fruit in this book except for citrus um so

for those sensitive beings this is a good book for you for those of you who don’t have issues with

any of that um this is also just a highly um flavorful book i talk about um taste sensations there’s

a section on that in this book which which is basically talking about the tongue um so using

taste sensations as a tool and what what you know of that is is all the flavors so bitter salty sweet

sour and then this new flavor they talk about umami right which is like miso or

yes the way karmichan cheese yes yeah right um spicy pungent even um this flavor fatteness

which is which is the way like let’s say we we toss avocado in a dish that’s going to um move

flavor around the tongue so wow so because this book is is limited in things like grains or um

um yeah nothing else is coming to me at the moment but we we add a lot of things like citrus zest

and delicious healthy fats and things that really make flavors pop so if um if you can think of

of friends of yours that eat you know they go out and eat burgers and fries and they’re used to

food like that they’re still gonna enjoy this food because it’s it’s flavor heavy yeah i can

i can attest to that i have had many friends and joy this food as well yeah you mentioned oils

a few times and i’m curious tell us a little more about why certain oils are so good for us and

others maybe are not that good for us it what what’s going on with oils right so um what’s going

on with oils well we’ll need like another hour for that but um so the oils episode yeah the oils

episode um so i can talk about that from my own experience and i i have experimented with

ketogenic diet relatively often so when i’m needing to so ketogenic diet is um is a high fat medium

protein and very low-carb diet and um and it helps if you’re needing to trim up and it helps

if you’re needing to clear brain fog and um it’s it’s pretty magical and it’s difficult

but when i do it i’ll do it for like i don’t know three or four weeks and so i’ve learned a lot

about healthy fats when i when i do that and um what i’ve learned and what i’ve studied about

is that there are certain fats that are that are really good for the body and certain fats that

aren’t and so the types of fats in this book that i’ve suggested cooking with for high for high

temperature are um coconut oil uh ghee which is a refined clarified butter is that yeah

ghee is um butter without the milk solids right yeah and you can buy it yeah you can make it

yeah usually buy it yeah i know more or more folks seem to be using ghee yeah um my some of my

favorite fats to cook with are grass-fed beef tallow and um which has really good omega

yeah chicken fat duck fat for Thanksgiving we roasted a duck and made duck soup and then we had

all of this duck fat and we’re still cooking with it and it’s incredible wow yeah and everything

just seems to um work better in the body and so when i say i’m speaking for my experience

what’s my experience is when i’m eating fats like this it’s um it’s more harmonious

well i know you as a friend of many years and i know that you’re very connected to body that you’re

very body centered in what you do and you’re a dancer you you teach dance and i’m wondering if

you can share with us a bit about that that body connection as a dancer and how that kind of

relates over to your work as a chef in your work with food yeah that’s a big question

is that that’s another episode yeah um well i think in general like it’s in everything that i do

in my in my outer world it’s and in my inner world it’s important for me to stay connected to my

body and and i don’t always i mean i can find myself really in my head at times i think at the club

at city club um i manage quite a bit and um yeah you have a lot of responsibility and i love it

you know yeah and i really enjoy it but um but if i don’t go out and take that 20 minute walk

like the days that i don’t do it i notice it yeah and so the balance of um of life is is so important

and um and and it’s important to notice like when when things are off and notice when

when i got to go out and take that walk or notice when i haven’t um stop to eat lunch

yeah um when i’ve had too much caffeine and stay in tune with with all of that because it’s it’s

it’s certainly not about getting things perfect because every day i don’t get things perfect

yeah with regards to self care and and just noticing like what’s off how can i get back

um there’s a hang of time yeah what do i need now and what’s next and what do i need later at the end

of the day does it need to be a down night do i have it in me to be social um especially with this book

you know it’s been um it’s been a journey especially the last six months putting this book together

and um and if i didn’t i think i may have told you this the other day but if i didn’t push

the way that i did it wouldn’t have happened yeah it would have taken another year which

I’m sure you can relate to well the funny thing about books that i’ve noticed is they don’t

write themselves no it takes an incredible amount of of sustained uh energy willfulness discipline

uh to put something like this together and uh i i’m so grateful that that you’ve done it because i

know knowing you and eating your food is often as i do i know this is going to be just an amazing

resource for so many folks folks all over the place folks who you’ll you’ll probably never meet in

person and uh i’m just grateful that you’ve done the work and taken the the time to make this happen

while you’re also an executive chef at a very busy dining facility and doing all kinds of other

things in your life as well so uh yeah it’s funny you know it’s not it’s not really for me

like this this book like on a couple different levels so you know when you start writing and you have

a folder in your computer and it’s like why don’t we know what this book’s going to be called yet

so why do i call it so when i first started it five years ago it was just called an offering

that was the name of the folder yeah and um because that’s what it was because it was like okay i’m

giving this is like a giving giving and um and that’s what this that’s what this is uh i have

i have this coaching business that i’m that i’ve started and i’m working with clients and i’m

teaching them how to cook and they’re most generally people who don’t know much about food

generally people who are suffering in some way because they’re nutrient starving you know

they’re they’re not eating nutrient rich diets they’re eating um empty diets and so but they’re

really they’re really wanting to create change or else they wouldn’t be asking for help so um

and up until now i haven’t had this available so i’ve just been giving them the book

you know just been like passing them the book which has been so nice and it’s been uh it’s been

such a gift to see these recipes helping people and changing their lives and customizing them

to fit people’s needs yeah because everybody’s different and some people have really special

food needs it’s such an interesting uh observation that you’re making that is a truism i think for

our culture at this point our society that so many of us are going through day-to-day life

with incredible caloric intake right we have a very calorie rich

diet generally speaking but it’s often way too often nutrient bereft nutrient

devoid and we spoke about this a fair bit in in YonEarth and i think it’s one of the

greatest opportunities that we have to improve our own health and well-being our own quality of life

for ourselves the people around us our families and so on and it is also a beautiful way to be

in deeper stewardship of places farms soil people growing food cultivating food those two

really go hand in hand and uh one of the things that strikes me Maria and uh you your

chefery if that’s a word exemplifies this when we’re talking about increasing health and well-being

through our food and beverage choices this is far from an austerity program in my experience

the food you create is so abundant with flavor is bursting with incredible delightful

indulgence really in in the miraculous abundance of this this planet and my hope is that

folks will check this out and and experience this for themselves of course if you’re visiting

Denver or Boulder and can come up to the highland city club come for lunch um but you know

short of that this this is such a tremendous resource around that enjoyment of life that i

believe so many of us have in our cultural paratages back generations we have all around the

world rich traditions around food that are helpful and really enjoyable and i know in addition to

your Lebanese background with your grandmother you you also have had a restaurant in Spain

and many of your dishes have just an incredible Spanish zest and penache to them so i’m curious

tell us a little about the time in spain and what were you doing that yeah yeah from love with

saffron so there are it’s funny it’s not a dancer is he yeah let’s not go there

so it’s funny i was making the index and um i realized like how much saffron is in this book plus

the tremendous amount um so i yeah i think it was gosh nine years ago or eight years ago i was

looking on Craigslist or looking on yeah looking on Craigslist for a job and i saw that someone was

looking for a chef for Madrid for a place in Madrid and so i thought yeah i’ll look into that

and so long story short i got hired to open up um help open up a restaurant um in downtown Madrid

and it was called hardest and um they wanted a chef who had been involved with organic food and

they wanted a boulder chef that you know like big salads because they don’t do that in Spain um so

i and i i helped them i helped create the menu i had like some of my dishes and then helped

them with with their dishes and um yeah it just helped it was hired to help get it started

so i went over there for a year and um it was a wild experience i didn’t know any Spanish

really and i went there and i had a team of about five or six people in the kitchen none of them

spoke english i just had my my Spanish book learned on the job and uh yeah it was a trip amazing

i had my grandmother’s hummus recipe on the menu and they still do it there to my knowledge

i think yeah pretty sure they’re still open but it’s it’s been a number of years that’s wonderful

yeah is there a certain dish that you make regularly now that somehow reminds you of your

timing Madrid well we do pay a relatively regularly um and it’s more like techniques

you know like different broths that i learned how to do there i worked with a couple chefs there um

that taught me a lot so i had the opportunity to to work with some great chefs in that kitchen

it was it was lovely it was quite an experience it’s really grateful

it’s so beautiful yeah and it just it tells us a little more about the taste sensations i want to

come back to that because i have one yeah one of the things that strikes me i was thinking about

this the other day watching a movie with a lot of our technology of course we’re recording this

we have audio we have visual yeah what we don’t have is a roma and flavor right and to be able to

attempt to communicate just how amazing this yeah through audio visuals is a bit of a challenge

with sure we have words so we can attempt it right so there’s this one dish in the book um it’s

called sensational fish uh with spaghetti squash anchovies and cavers so um and this dish the

point of this dish is to highlight all the taste sensations so basically you have your your tongue

and to make a dish taste really powerful if that’s what you’re going for is to hit your whole tongue

and just pop it out right so that’s what this that’s what this does so you have the sour the sweet the

fatty the pungent the umami so for example um i used spaghetti squash at decent amount in this book

because it’s comforting right spaghetti squashes is um it’s comforting but it’s very low

carb it’s very low sugar so spaghetti squash will give you the sweet and that’s the bed of this dish

you have the umami from the fish because macro you choose between macro or cod in this dish

which is a very umami on the umami scale it’s a high it’s high in the umami the fatteness comes

from the cooking oil which is your choice of coconut oil or ghee or chicken fat or talo

another sweet is the caramelized onion you get the pungent flavor from the garlic

more umami from the anchovy you get the sour from the white wine

um you get more fatty from the avocado and then um and then you get the broth that’s underneath it

so something about this book is um the mineral rich bone broth which is um it’s very central to

to this this book many of the recipes have bone broth as uh as an ingredient so um that’s all

I’ll say about that for now but um yeah that’s a little more but yeah it’s kind of a fun recipe

to try it actually uh if you if you aren’t quite ready to buy the book you could go on uh

shethmariecooper.com and this recipe is on the website on the on the blog so share that one

yeah yeah you could grab that one on the website and if if folks are interested in your um

consulting and coaching service can they find information about that at the web as well?

actually um currently i’m doing free discovery sessions for the coaching so um yeah you can

just schedule a 20 minutes free session with me through the website wonderful yeah wonderful

and maybe i’ll take this opportunity to remind our audience that this is the YonEarth Communities

stewardship and sustainability podcast series and today we’re speaking with shethmariecooper

those uh as a way to celebrate our discussion today and uh all this talk of food maria is making me

a little hungry are you hungry of what should we try something i see there’s something amazing sitting

here and i probably cannot resist it any longer okay all right what do we got so this is a recipe

from the book um we have i will let you hold it and maybe i’ll pull the recipe as if we can talk

about it so these are truffles so i do have some desserts in this book and um these are decadent

power truffles wow and they have no sugar in them they have um i actually did that there’s this

website you can go on and do the whole nutritional breakdown of them so they have i think like

one carb in there or something so can i have one yeah you can have one okay i’m going for this kind

which one is this they’re the same they just they just have different um topping so this is

pistachio dusted and this is um oh my goodness oh my goodness so you can make these with carrot powder

or cocoa powder and the way they’re made is with um coconut milk that’s been reduced a whole lot

so it’s like really really thick and then you stir in um and you kind of nut butter or seed

butter that you like and there’s a lot of spices there’s fresh ginger there’s a lot going on

they’re a little cardamom i’m getting there’s um so there’s ginger there’s lemon zest there’s

orange zest there’s um there’s so there’s sweetened with stevia but if you can’t do stevia you can do

any kind of sweetener that works for you i like liquid stevia because it doesn’t have

it doesn’t affect your blood sugar anyway in any way and it’s um it’s not bitter like powdered

stevia and there’s not that much in in the recipe these are amazing good there’s vanilla

yeah and you can coat them in whatever you like so and i like to keep them in the freezer

and it’s nice my my partner’s son he likes um sweets and so he eats these and it doesn’t have

any effect on his you know on his wildness he just eats them and they actually study them out

because they have the uh the protein in them from the nuts wow so uh is amazing i’m so glad you like

them and when they when they’re dusted in cocoa they’re really just like eating chocolate

you know it’s just like eating a chocolate treat but way more nutritious yeah they’re

different breakfast too there’s um a couple more truffle recipes in the book and there’s also a

um a avocado mousse recipe which is a really a really nice dessert it’s creamy and it’s made with

uh with cashews wow Maria that’s amazing i might have to put it in order in for some more

you can have the rest by ten thank you so much yeah you got it so i want to make sure that we’ve

covered everything we wanted to discuss today before wrapping up i know we’ve got a few minutes

remaining with our episode is there anything on your end that you want to make sure we mention or

hit on um i think we i think we did it yeah i feel like things are pretty covered

nice i’d like to hear about your food my food yeah i’d like to hear about how you’re doing with uh

with with your cooking and is there anything you want to talk about with your cooking oh my gosh

well i love eating i love cooking i’m a total amateur and i love hanging out with experts like you

and um one of the kind of grab and go things i enjoy uh throwing in my bag in the morning is just

a big hearty salad and that way i know i’m getting my leafy greens my chlorophyll my various

colors i’ve been really into cucumbers lately for some reason i don’t know exactly why and uh

it’s soup and stew season so yeah making things like chili blanco is uh one of my favorites

was turkey it’s time of year it could be or with chicken or yeah um other you know other

approaches that i usually make it with pizole in there and quite a lot of cumin it’s very like

cumin intense yeah and uh cumin forward cumin forward yeah um and it’s just it’s so comforting heartwarming

and satisfying what kind of chicken do you get do you get like chicken thighs or do you put a

whole chicken or yeah generally enjoy uh baking a number of chicken thighs that i’ve seasoned

okay beforehand and i usually do that with skin off and i’m kind of uh one of those weirdos who

really enjoys baked chicken skin for some reason and i love it i love it yeah so i’ll often have

that as a treat while i’m preparing the soup and in tearing the the meat up my hand to put into the

the soup um i think i do a mere plot a little bit at the beginning sometimes but not every time

and there’s usually a fair bit of garlic in there too um so it’s fun it’s easy and if we make a big

pot of it uh as you were speaking to earlier there are often you know eight ten twelve meals in there

that can be ready to roll throughout the week throughout busy days um so that’s a lot of fun

yeah yeah yeah i think um soups and stews right now are are amazing and freezing them and

you know the one one thing about these uh recipes in this book is most of them are better than

the next day yeah or the day after that and so um and a lot of them are great in the freezer

and so you know taking the time to make your own um your own chicken broth your own

bone broth is it makes such a difference and it’s so it’s so nourishing

is it a is it a fairly complicated process you know i’m wondering if folks might be a bit

intimidated because it sounds like it could be intimidating no no i mean generally there’s a

couple different ways you can do it so the way that we do it often is is we like to we like to buy

rotisserie chickens from home foods the organic ones yeah because they’re pretty affordable

mm-hmm i think right now they’re like nine ninety nine right so we’ll buy two and we’ll take the

um we’ll take the meat off yeah and we’ll make a big chicken salad for the week would not

to get the fridge and then we have two heart kisses we’ll throw them in a big pot with water

and you put a little bit apple cider vinegar yeah i’ve heard that because that helped my mom

that hurts take the goodness out of the bones you let sit for an hour turn it on and cook it for

six hours wow so you let it simmer you let it sit with no heat no heat for an hour then you put

it on heat that’s it yeah i mean at the last hour of cooking you can toss in some uh onions and

celery carrots if you want but i don’t usually i’ve even heard folks will use their onion

peels and their carrot onions at that stage a way to use some of those things that would

other good wise go to college yeah you can and while you’re cooking through the week if you end up

having those a nice thing to do is throw those in a bag in the freezer and then when you’re ready

to make socks you got it ready you got it ready to go that’s such a great idea yeah and um but you

know having broth um even without the veggies is fine i guess it still makes delicious soup because

usually when you make soup you’re cooking veggies you’re chopping up veggies subtaining them

and then throwing the broth in so you’re going to have the flavor of that veggies those veggies

anyways yeah yeah um but it really helps us through these cold months to be

eating soup or even like drinking that broth regularly i have a recipe it’s more like a tip i think

in the book but to to be drinking broth as a meal or in between meals it’s called warm liquid

gold i saw that but you um you heat up the broth and then you you stir in some some fat of your

choice chicken fat or um coconut oil or olive oil or something put a little bit of sea salt

you could put cinnamon or something and just drink it and it’s nourishing and it coats your belly

and it prepares you for what’s next you know i think it’s a nice thing to do it reminds me of a

remedy that a dear friend in fact an old love of mine taught me which is to use chicken broth when

we’re getting sick and adding in cayenne and i think some black pepper yeah maybe some turmeric

and a little bit of lemon juice and just drinking that and it’s it helps and so another great reason

to keep some of this broth on hand right if we start to feel that tickle in the throat or we’re

starting to feel worn down it’s another excellent potential remedy we can go to yeah and uh

you’re you’re you’re what is it liquid gold what is it warm liquid gold warm liquid gold yeah i mean

this woman that i’m i’m working with currently i work with her on the phone coaching she lives

back east and she works in jails every day and um she gets up really early and goes to jails and

works in jails every day and she drinks her broth before she goes to work every day and it’s like

saving her you know she that’s how she talks about it um and i think part of all of these practices

whether it’s making broth or drinking broth or slowing down to cook a meal um it’s self-care

and um you may ask yourself like are you doing enough of that for yourself maybe you are

i mean i’m not sometimes um sometimes i am but when i do that it’s in the act of doing it

that actually makes me feel more vital it gives me strength and makes me feel like

more fit you know i’m giving myself that message that i’m i’m worth this self nourishment yeah

it’s so powerful yeah and it takes remembering and it takes doing and practicing it just like

anything else yeah i love that yeah i love that yeah well Maria thank you so much for joining us
