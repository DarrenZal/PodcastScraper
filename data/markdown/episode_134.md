## ABOUT HILDEGARD VON BINGEN

Impacting great figures from Bernard de Clairvaux to Thomas Aquinas, Meister Eckhart, Francis of Assisi, Julian of Norwich, and Albertus Magnus, Hildegard von Bingen emanates influential ripples throughout society and across time. She celebrates music, song, joy, wetness, the dripping “sap of life”, the greening power of the Holy Spirit, and the special invitation to co-create with Divine immanence that is among our unique birthrights as human beings. With roots in the Celtic mysticism of pre-historic Europe and even lesser-known connectivity between Celtic peoples and the Hopi and other indigenous nations across the Atlantic, Hildegard von Bingen represents a certain AI – “authentic intelligence” – that is essential for the great turning that humanity is currently experiencing on planet Earth in the 21stcentury.

Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today

we have the opportunity to visit with spiritual elder, author, and activist Matthew Fox.

Hey Matthew, how you doing? Oh, you’re good to be with you. It’s good to be with you

as well, my friend. And I’m really looking forward to our conversation and sharing it with our

audience. Matthew Fox is an elder activist, spiritual theologian and the author of 40 books on

spirituality and culture. He has taught at Stanford University and is the founder of the University

of Creation Spirituality. He was a member of the Dominican Order of the Roman Catholic Church

for 34 years until silenced by the Vatican in 1989 and formally dismissed in 1993. Now in

Episcopal priest, he travels extensively, sharing his vision of a spirituality that includes

mysticism and social justice rather than patriarchal orthodoxy. And that celebrates the marriage

of the divine feminine and the sacred masculine. And Matthew for our conversation today, I’m

so thrilled that while we’re going to discuss a few different dimensions of your work and some of

your other books, we’re going to focus for the most part on this particular work that you’ve

written about Hildegard of being in a saint for our times, unleashing her power in the 21st century.

And I’m curious to ask just to kick things off. Matthew, why Hildegard from being in what’s

important about a woman from some 900 years ago to our world today?

Well, she was a Benedictine Abbas in the 12th century. In the 12th century, she was a very special

century. A parishioner of mine meant to his greatest story and says the 12th century Renaissance

is the only Renaissance that worked in the West. At the 16th century of the Renaissance, it gets all

the news and the spotlight. It was tapped down, but the 12th century was bottom up. It was freed

serves. It was young people therefore. And it was women. And it was a different kind of

Renaissance from the bottom up. And Hildegard lived through that. She lived from 1098 to

when 1181 I think. So she lived through a big part of the 12th century and she was a big part of

that because she was such a genius in music, for example, but also in she wrote 10 books,

several of them on science. As far as they had science in that day, one book is all about

stones and rocks and animals and trees and so forth. And she had this voracious curiosity.

And she was a shaker and a mover. She was a painter. She wrote the oldest opera in the

West for 300 years, including the libretto. She was a poet. And she was a healer. And she

she was shoot her womanfully. She grew up, if you will, in a Catholic monastery, but for men and

women lived together, though in different parts of the building, but they got together. And

when her first book came out, it became so popular that a lot of women were on display with her.

So they came to the monastery to join and the men wouldn’t move over and give rooms. So she took

all her nuns and moved out with their dowries. Back then, you’d have a dowry to be in that.

And started her own monastery and it became so full. She has started a second one across the river

Rhine. And we have a letter from the abbot saying, oh, come back, come back, bring the nuns and

bring their dowries with you. And her letter back to him, which we have is all about injustice.

So she didn’t think she was treated well. So she has moved down. So she was a strong woman

in a time of great efforts by the patriarchal establishment to keep women in their place.

And she did not, can I say, go along with that, happily. So she’s a tremendous figure.

She would just canonize the saint about 10 years ago and made a doctor of the church.

And there are only three other women who were doctor of the church. So she was a genius.

No question about it and a great soul. And so she’s speaking to us today because one thing,

she’s so earth conscious that she has an entire understanding of the importance of it. She

calls guys about mother earth, who’s the mother of all things. He pays the seeds of all things.

And she says, we must not destroy mother earth. And so obviously she’s an equal prophet. She’s

great voice in favor of opening up our minds that we’re not just here to serve each other,

but to serve future generations and earth itself and the other creatures. So she’s a real ecological

prophet in that way. And she has a lot of lessons that are really important to us today.

I really appreciate how in the book it tees out so much of her wisdom and thread those lessons

together with some other more contemporary authors works. And one of the things you mentioned

very early on in the book is that pilgrimage from Bingan is a herald of the divine feminine.

And I was hoping you could walk us through. What does that mean? And why is that especially important

now given the history and the legacy of an out of balanced patriarchy?

Yes, you know, Rosemary Ruther was great,

Catholic women, theologian, feminist theologian. She says that the basis of patriarchy and its shadow

side is dualist, a separation of matter and spirit, separation of soul and body and so forth.

And Yildegard in so many ways heals that dualism. But she talks about how

forace is present and everything, how there is a radiance in all beings. And that radiance

is the docks of the glory of the divine. And so she brings us back to to this consciousness

of microcosm and macrocosm. That too is your sin. We see of this psychology. And by the way,

Carl Jung knew Yildegard very well. And he says the future psychology is microcosm, macrocosm.

So that we humans are the microcosm. We’re a small cosmos. But we relate to the whole cosmos,

the macrocosm. Well, that opens a door to web telescope and everything you’re learning about

the cosmos to the 13.8 billion year story that we’re learning about our history and that of the

earth and all the rest. So it’s a tremendous opening because modern consciousness and obviously

Yildegard is pre-modern living in the Torah century. But she thinks like indigenous people do

you see. In fact, the very first time they translated her a couple of her poems. And I share them

in class, a master’s degree class. I just shared one of her poems. And me and this young man

spoke up. He said, I’ve just returned from living on a Indian reservation for 13 years.

That lady you just cited sounds exactly like the medicine man who was my spiritual teacher,

spiritual director. I was just hit by that. I was amazed. First time in a dawn that made

that a 12th century man is thinking like a 20th century Lakota man, medicine man. And she is,

because of course all medieval mystics, Master of Eckhart and Thomas Aquinas and Francis of

Acesia of course in Julian North. They all thought more like indigenous people do than modern

consciousness does because the modern begins with the human, with the part and not with the whole

day card. I think therefore I know, Mr. Daykart, you are because 13.8 billion years

burst you, earth the earth and all that consists. So you know, it’s not all about I. And yet the

modern culture has been all about I and that’s why it’s all collapsing today. That’s why education

is a working religion isn’t working and economic and politics aren’t working. And the earth

herself, of course, is under stress. So all this is part of healed guys way of seeing the world,

seeing the context in which humans bring something special. We bring our creativity and she’s,

she herself is a proof of that with her gifts of music and painting and healing and so much else.

She’s so in touch with her deeper nature and her creative nature. So all this is part of the

return of compassion and the return of the feminine energy of creativity and wisdom. She says,

this is a great line. She says, there’s wisdom in all creative works, wisdom in all creative works.

We see our patriarchal educational system for centuries has focused on knowledge and we’ve

discovered a lot. We discovered so much. We got in their computers to store all our information.

But where are we on the spectrum of wisdom? We’re going to come to wisdom. We’re pretty short

shorted. And so we should be looking at people like I killed the guard for wisdom that matches

our knowledge because knowledge alone can grow up the world as we know and as we can see going

on in Ukraine. So she remembered that wisdom is feminine around the world,

feminine in the biblical languages, feminine around the book, cornean and all the rest.

And of course compassion is a feminine energy. It really comes from the word for womb in both

Hebrew and Arabic. The word for womb gives us the word for compassion. So and that doesn’t mean

women hold all compassion or women hold all wisdom. It’s about really recovering the deeper

dimensions of masculinity that are left out when patriarchy is defining masculinity in its very

limited way of the reptilian brain being number one and conquering everyone else like a reptile

crocodile. So this is why he’ll regard can shake up both their understanding of the feminine

but our understanding of the masculine as well and of our institutions. In fact, I am that book

and you got that far but it’s kind of a satirical my conclusion chapter is entitled

is he’ll regard a Trojan horse and the Vatican because the person who

worked for canonizer mayor Dr. Tursk is Karna Raja here at Benedict the 16th book and he’s

anything but a feminine stem. He came after me. His first objection of my work was called

I am a feminist theologian. And his second objection was that I call God mother. So that fellow

is a no-way kind of god side and it comes to your feminism. But that’s why I call her Trojan horse.

He named her a saint and adopted the church and wheeled her right into the hatch and

front door at the Vatican’s front door and this lady is going to

call out of that horse with a lot of other strong women and men who are in touch with the

feminine angle on things and could really do a job on our patriarchal institutions

and the Roman Catholic Church is a pretty good place to start.

No doubt about it. It’s so interesting to me how that

sense of spiritual connection that is so profoundly connected to the natural living world,

to Mother Earth, to creation, to the the greening power of the plant kingdom that provides life to

this planet. And it seems there’s so many of us these days Matthew who are so disconnected from

that intimate relationship that Hildegard speaks of. So many of us not even aware that we’re

disconnected, not even aware that there’s this entirely different way of being in communion and

community with the living earth. And I’m curious because I think this is such a foundational,

important aspect of Hildegard’s work and what she means in our time today. What does this

look like and mean to you, this intimate connection with nature? Why is it important? How do we

cultivate it? Well I like that you just use the the term intimate twice because that’s so much

apart of it. Recovering our intimate relationship to nature because after all nature feeds us

and nature is us and our breath is in all the languages of the world practically certainly

biblical in the but around the world. The word for spirit and breath are the same words.

So and of course we now know that breath as we know it is the air that we breathe but it

it runs out about 10 miles from here and when you get up to the stratosphere there’s no air so

you know our astronauts have to bring air with them and so forth. So you know the lesson is hey

don’t take it for granted, don’t take air for granted, don’t take healthy air for granted,

and don’t take your lungs for granted you know. So as you say what’s more intimate than air,

you know the breath that we breathe and you know a lot of spiritual practices,

meditations are indeed about paying attention to your breath not taking it for granted and following

that rhythm putting yourself in the presence of breath and rhythm but it’s not just breath that

gives us this food literally plants and photosynthesis and animals of eat plants and birds of

eat plants and all the rest. So I mean where are we without nature? We’re we’re dead. We’re out of here

and so again we can take for granted for so long and I think that again the modern era the great

rust of the whole era was about conquering and about knowledge and knowledge in itself is not

bad but let’s know it’s too little wisdom is very very dangerous in the hands of human beings

because we can tear down a rainforest in a day that has taken nature and got 10,000 years to

give birth to and once we tear down a rainforest it doesn’t come back as a rainforest.

So and rainforests we’re learning more or more so basic to our survival not just because

of the absorbed accompanied oxide and recyclence of the earth but also because there’s so many plants

that are medicinal there so many we haven’t even discovered yet that there’s so many other gifts

that the rainforest gives us but we all have to recover we’ll you say this intimate relationship

and that with earth and that’s how Hildegard talks to she actually says that the relationship of

the divine tool nature is that of our husband to wife and of lovers to each other that there’s

something intimate going on here between the the creator and creation and why would we want

not to be part of that and so her approach to ecology is not about stewardship it’s not about

we have to do this duty it is about how to lovers act with each other and you know you don’t ignore

any other and you don’t take for granted and you give and you receive and again this is a very

indigenous approach to our relationship to the earth that you can’t just be taking all the time

as a species we have to give back as well we have to return and recycle and we have to think

of future generations how healthy with our grandchildren’s world be in terms of earth air

fire energy and water though there are essential questions today as they have always been only

today we’re in a perilous situation obviously that we’re coming to the to the end of the

life in our species is so overdone our rapacious reptilian brain approach to nature that nature is

beginning to bite us and she she predicted that would have but she said we live in a in a web

of life creation as a web and we’re in this web with all these other creatures and of course

a web is flexible it goes at the wind and so forth it’s strong the flexible is not rigid

but she says if human injustice and greed breaks this web the way she puts it is God will allow

creation to punish humanity so as not God coming at us with vengeance it’s creation that if we

cannot honor the other creatures and the our relationships with them in this web that if we

break the web well and that’s what we want by scientific to see is you’re going to rise

and they’re going to be drought through already is they’re going to be more floods and more

hurricanes than there already is and more wildfires and there already is that going on so you know

she actually I think warn us what what an ego approach to nature does which includes of course

forgetting and just thinking it’s a it’s a resource that we can extract continually obviously

it’s a finite resource and we cannot just extract but you know there are many humans today a lot

of scientists who are of course seeing the children we’re in and are putting in the gear are

wonderful imaginations and intellects to create alternative energy and all the rest and she

talks about that too she says the greatest gift that humans have is our intellect and which is

a acknowledgement obviously that a healthy feminine like a healthy masculine honors the rational

as well as the intuitive and she she had both her that’s where she was so

keen on science she says all science comes from God so there’s nothing anti intellectual about

hooligan she was thoroughly curious and a student of science and so far as it was

available in her time there’s one story about it like this planet says a lot about a

one day she got a message from Switzerland that there is a a possessed woman in Switzerland

they wanted her to come down and do an exercise she woke back and said I don’t do exercise but

boy do I want to see a possessed woman so I’m getting on the next level so I just think that’s

very telling of her personality she was radically curious as any good scientist should be and she

was going to check it out for herself telling us a fun story of other things and by the way she

was preaching all over Germany and Switzerland too and we have letters from Bishop saying

will you send us a copy of your the sermon you gave people are still talking about it and it’s

been three months since you were here so and her main message was to syrup the clergy she said

the clergy are too lazy they’re not prophetic enough and she wrote letters to the emperor to the

Pope to Archbishop’s to Abbas telling them they were failing and they were she told the Pope he was

wrong about evil man who who act like hands and packing at night and so forth he’s evil people

around you and everything and she wrote the emperor of our brochure and said you know man up you’re

acting like a baby your job is to do justice it’s not to

bring yourself in all their best and she wrote Abbas instead that they acted like asses and

donkeys and bears they rumble like a bear I mean she didn’t hold back when she took on the

potentates of her time and yet they listened to her I think they were scared of her frankly because

she claimed to have visions she painted her visions and I think they figured that she had more

access to this virtual world than they did and and they were probably right wow

you mentioned Switzerland and Germany and in the book you discuss what you call the

Rhineland Mystic movement and of course the Rhine River runs from Switzerland down to the

northwest more or less to the lowlands of Germany and out toward Holland can you tell us a bit

about this region and what was going on in this time and and how there are other important

individuals some of whom you’ve already mentioned in addition to Hildegard von Bingen that were in

this region out this time and kind of what was going on in the world them sure and of course

Bingen is right on the Rhine and you can visit her monastery today by his current state the

the one she built was the store in the 17th century by the Swedish Swedes when they invaded

but they built no one better than the same grounds but yeah I call it a grandmother Rhineland

Mystics and the Rhine and Mystic movement certainly includes Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas

he studied in Cologne and Albert worked in Cologne and of course I’m nice to Eckhart because

he worked in Strasbourg and in Cologne Christian Cologne and there and Chris Arain was was a great river

not unlike the Mississippi in terms of its its dominance its importance for commerce and business and

of course on that time you didn’t have the highways we have today or you had your roads but the

point is you did most of the work by by boat and so you these great cities were on the Rhine and

so you had the the Celts settled there early and here we go there’s actually an

Celtic monastery on the Rhine in Germany and that’s why she lived in a by gender monastery because

the Celts weren’t those about bringing men and women together they weren’t as hung up on

sexes of seven Europeans were like a destined and in Italy but so the Rhine even produced I

think the Rhine and Mystics I think Francis of Assisi though he lived in Northern Italy but the

Celts sold into Northern Italy and the Francis of Sisi is very Celtic also in his spirituality like

he’ll be got very nature oriented very oriented to the animals and to the cosmos too

um his greatest poem he doesn’t even mention Jesus once but he talks about brother son and sister

moon and silver so a very cosmic view of the world very Celtic therefore and um so and then Julian

Norwich of course lived in England not on the Rhine literally but in fact she’s are the Rhine and

Mystic movement because she drew from these great mystics that came from the Rhine directly or

indirectly so Hildegard was first Francis of Sisi was born two years after Hildegard died

so the lineage goes Hildegard Francis then Thomas Aquinas mech till the Maid de Berwick

Maid de Berwick is a city in Germany and um and then myster Eckhard as I say who was um

who worked on the Rhine and and was German from Therengia and then um Julian Norwich over over

in Norwich so so it’s a wonderful movement of healthy creation centered and really Celtic based

um uh mystic prophets they weren’t just mystics they also stood up and were counted and got in

trouble I mean that’s why you know Hildegard wasn’t or was again a nice for 800 years that’s a

long time to wait that’s like a record almost and why well because when she was 81 she was

excommunicated by an Irish Bishop along with Oliver Nuns they were interdicted which means

her whole monastery was excommunicated totally shut up they couldn’t even sing the office anymore

and she wrote a letter back to the Irish Bishop and said oh dear Irish Bishop we are obeying you

we’re not singing our our office and nor our arm and uh she said you’ve silenced the most beautiful

music on the Rhine meaning her own which was literally true and uh and then she said all

prophesied music she talked about David and she talked about all the office who made music and

what but you’ve chosen to silence music and she she goes on and on at the end she signs it at

space she says those who choose to silence music in this lifetime will go to a place in the next

where there is no music now for literally for Hildegard that literary means she’s telling the

Bishop he’s going to hell because when Hildegard did her opera uh it’s about the virtues the play

of the virtues and so charity is singing away and and countenance is singing away and wisdom is

singing away but the devil in the play is walking around talking and mumbling he can’t sing you say

devils devils don’t say she thinks heaven is a place of music and um so that has to be most the

most creative way anyone has ever told the Irish Bishop they’re going to hell and I think that’s

one very important reason why she was a can of dance for 800 years it took the hierarchy that

but should I say get over that particular insult wow yeah speaking of the the virtues and I love

the music thread I’ll come back to that especially with your beautiful painting with Miles Davis

behind you there and I love how there’s some some verdant green in there like some Veridi toss right

in there uh yes and of course you took the Veridi toss Hildegard’s word for greening bar has

the title for your important novel too so that’s a special connection you to have obviously

but remember that word for her so rich she says that where this she compares greening power

Veridi toss to the sap of a tree and she compares it to the Holy Spirit she says the Holy Spirit

is green and of course green is the heart chakra color isn’t it so uh and of course it’s very

important to the Catholic people isn’t it the green Shamrock and all that so all this greening

power she is a very important concept tour it’s really her central concept and um it is about the

inherent energy and and sap of um of life and this is really what what spirituality is all about is

is getting in tune with that with that sap and that energy he says for example the only sin

in life is drying up she says and um she writes bishops and abbots and says get out of your libraries

you’re you’re drying up do whatever it takes to get wet and green and moist and juicy those are

her words the asus spiritual is about staying green and staying creative and clearly she was

walking her talk and uh preaching from her own experience there because she was so so creative

and uh uh deliberate in her awareness as she she has a form she says oh Trinity you are music

you are life so um this uh this whole idea that the music is is behind everything and you know

I think that’s today’s physics actually that vibration is what makes things go around that every

Adam and universe is vibrating well that’s what music is it’s vibration and she she picked up

the music of this fear she talks about she gathered her singular songs uh and there are 72 of them

and the titles she gave the collection was the symphony of the heavenly revelations so um you know

today scientists are picking up the sounds even of the earliest um uh sounds of the universe

and so sound is with us all the time and um you know the the Hindus talk about and the

beginning was the sound and and of course Charles gospel has it the beginning was the word

that he’ll be guarded and uh and remember the kales win flims by the hinduism i mean the kales

came from india so um in a way he’ll be guarded saying in the beginning was the music and uh

make sure this is what the aboriginal is an australia say they say that and that uh every creature has

its own is was born with its own song and the life’s journey is discovering that song and then

putting it in harmony with other beings songs so that we live harmoniously and i think it’s a very

beautiful way of seeing the world and again it’s um it’s microcosm and macrocosm finding

the sound of the universe and um in letting it stir us and keep us green i remember a reading

in one of my favorite books called nada brahma the world is sound by the german author yachim

and he apparently was instrumental in you know pun intended in bringing together some of the western

jazz musicians with some of the eastern classical indian uh raga musicians and anyway in that book he

talks about there was a uh jazz uh musician i’m forgetting his name who identified the f sharp

note as the green note and it turns out that with our uh modern instrumentation we’re able to

uh determine that when photosynthesis is occurring the chlorophyll is vibrating at a very high

frequency overtone of f sharp and so it’s indeed a green note uh yeah and so i mean there there really

is such an incredible fundamental connection between tone vibration sound music and creation

creativity and of course hildegard emphasized the importance of creativity as a way of being almost

a spiritual practice and you lay out in the in the book four different ways right the the via

positiva negative uh et cetera and i was hoping you might walk us through Matthew quickly those uh

those four different ways of approaching our our spiritual life and our our work our service

in the world yeah yes and i found these in in uh my strach are actually they weren’t

explicitly named there but they’re definitely there so the via positiva is our experience of

awe and wonder enjoy and reverence and gratitude flows from that via negative it is first of all

our experience of silence that emptiness we often call it mindfulness or or contemplation

but it’s also our experience of suffering and grief and loss chaos and or and what miss is called

the dark air of the soul so all that is part of the via negative and and we all go through these

this rhythm of positive and negative then there’s a via creativa comes next because out of this

emptying that happens in the via negative uh comes birth comes new birth new ideas and a response

that we make to both the joys of life and the suffering of life and uh that’s our creativity

but our creativity needs steering it needs direction because we can do what we want creativity we can

create nuclear weapons we can invade another country like Ukraine we can tear down

rainforest in a day that’s all creative but of a negative kind so the via transfer of

anger comes next and that’s the way of compassion and justice and it’s a way of healing and of

celebration compassion is not only about relieving pain it’s also about gathering to share the joy

and to heal and to gin up the energy of the community so i see those four paths as meaning and

they don’t stop with the via jump from it here then because i see it as an open-ended spiral that

grows and so i see it went back then to the via positive because the purpose of justice is to

bring more people to the to the banquet of life if you will and that’s then we’re back to the via

positive again and we go through those uh that journey again and you can see in hildegard this she is

playing at this depth on a regular basis at all four of the of the four paths are um named by her

they’re named in her music uh they’re named in her writing and they’re even named in her life

as the hour and in all of our lives so i think it’s a very solid way uh then assured by jewish scholars

that it is the biblical way of Judaism uh to name the these spiritual journey and in this way

that it culminates with justice and compassion but it begins with um gratitude and and notice

even Genesis one doesn’t say anything about evil it’s all about how good nature is and when

humans come on which is very late as it is in the new scientific story we’re very late um everything

is very good so that’s what i mean by original blessing it a term that got got me in a lot of trouble

with the Vatican the previous Vatican out the current one but um uh that original goodness is

is the name of the game to be born into a planet as unique and special as this that works and as

all this beautiful diversity from giraffes and elephants to rainforests and the rest um why wouldn’t

we want to call that blessing as another word for goodness and build on that and i think that’s

the big struggle we’re in is a species that we’ve got our own agenda we’ve been

going each other for long enough that seems to be one of our favorite agendas and we’ve got to tap

tap more into the mammal brain which is that brain that’s capable of kinship the family and

forgiveness and uh and compassion and so um you know that’s how we’ve got to move is a species

we’re gonna survive and uh i think that’s where we’re at kind of historically and and great mystics

that killed the garden their own way um they just out for us and you know she she wrote a lot

about evil about humane’s capacity for evil but she always balances it like she had one book

where she lists thirty six human vices but is balanced by thirty six uh human virtues if you will

powers and uh that’s how she teaches about ethics and morality that we’ve got these choices and um

you know we really ought to live up to them and grow up that’s why i say she could a size emperor for

being a baby and uh and not manning up not not being an adult choosing wisely and and the you know

to bring about justice which she considered his job is about finding ballots and it’s not just yielding

to your whims for power for power sake and all therest yeahI’m so struck by the profound connection between creativity and justice and service, the sense of service.

I think often in our contemporary culture, we get the sense of a creative artist type as being very self-absorbed and not necessarily consciously working in service to humanity or perhaps it’s only through the art itself, right?

And with an individual like Hildegard, we see this far more expansive approach to being in service across a variety of disciplines, while also being a very creative artist.

And it makes me think of one of the vices that you call out in the book, one that gets translated as sloth, as Sadia, I guess is the term we derived this from in the Greek.

Can you tell us a bit, Matthew, about this Sadia, and really what it might mean is providing us a little bit of wisdom and insight in these days when I think so many of us and feeling like, you know, perhaps there’s not much we can do in the world right now and we decide to sit on our couches and said, right?

Yes, Thomas Aquinas defines a Sadia as a lack of energy to begin new things.

And I think that’s very practical, very down the earth, a lack of energy to begin new things.

And I think it’s so prevalent that in our lifetime, we’ve invented a new word for us, fistful around, and that word is couch potatoitis, as you just alluded to, that is being passive.

And those who make the real decisions, the corporations and the powers behind them want us to be that way.

This is the agenda that we be passive and that them make all the decisions.

Well, I think it’s been proven that making decisions to tear down rain for us and to to mine, our carbon based energy is a bad decision.

It’s going to kill the planet as we know it and certainly our species is manure.

So we’ve got a decision making and to get involved means to stand up to a city, it means to, and then Aquinas says, what’s the solution to a city?

And he says that that zero comes from an intense experience of the beauty of things.

I think it’s so beautiful.

Zero comes. That’s energy. That’s the opposite of a city. That’s getting out of our cost, but you know, zero comes from the intense experience of the beauty of things.

That beauty is an answer that being in love, and that’s another thing moving from the anthropocentric consciousness of the modern era, I think, before I am.

Hopefully more broad cosmological self is a recognition that that the beauty of things, the beauty of the earth, as you were talking about the intimacy, you know, just it can be a, it can be a hummingbird.

It can be something that small that alerts us.

They were living in a place that we didn’t make. We didn’t make this planet. We didn’t make the earth. We didn’t make our bodies.

Really, we certainly didn’t make the air our bodies breathe. So you know, let’s just get a little humble and ask, where is the future lie?

And it lies with that intuition of beauty and falling in love. So again, the modern conscience has us falling in love with one too late a person until death to us park.

Well, for sure, that doesn’t always work. Secondly, it’s an office small part of the world. No, we need to follow the world. It may be for us and maybe wildflowers and maybe animals. It may be poetry, it may be music, but that’s what we have to open up.

And that’s pathway to moving beyond the city is falling in love with something bigger than ourselves. And that’s that’s the way.

So I think that a city of names a real problem in our civilization today. So big a problem that we’ve made up a new word for it.

That’s always a good sign. Check the vocabulary. If you need a new word like couch potatoitis, well, you’re undergoing something that other species that other times of humans have not undergo.

You know, you know, there is a Australian theologian lecturing in Africa a few years ago. And he came to the combination of a study. He’d been translated after East-Santons he would pause it.

They would transcend this way. Evie. And the last sentence was the number one spiritual problem in Sydney today is loneliness.

And the translator huddled with some others that when you repeat that sentence, please, you repeated it. So they huddled and he came to my friends. I’m sorry, sir. There is no word in our language for loneliness.

Well, God, no word in the language for loneliness. And you know, if we know anything, we know about cosmic loneliness in English and in America and in Australia.

So I mean, language tells us a lot, doesn’t it? And I think, of course, we’re lonely because we’re out of touch with the intimacy, as you said, of the rest of nature.

And when you’re living enough, just a man-made bubble loneliness is a daily happening.

So that’s just an example, I think, that we have to move out of this acedia, this cost potatoitis. And the path is path of beauty and falling in love with things that are other than just the human.

I so appreciate that particular theme and thread Matthew. And maybe I’ll remind our audience. This is the YonEarth community podcast. And I’m your host, Aaron William Perry.

And today we’re visiting with author spiritual elder Matthew Fox, who’s written several books. We’re discussing quite a bit the hildegarde of being in a safe for our times.

And I want to also ask in a moment and question about your other book order of the sacred earth, your other book amongst some 40 different books.

And real quick, I’ll give a shout out to some of our sponsors who make this hot cast series possible. That includes Purium, organic super foods. And by the way, you can get special deals and discounts with many of our sponsors at YonEarth.org on our partners and supporters page.

This includes Purium, earth hero, another that provides a variety of sustainability products for the home, the workplace, et cetera.

Soil works are in house biodynamic blended soil, nutrient additive for your garden in your yard, your house plants.

And of course, waylay waters are biodynamically and regeneratively grown hemp infused aroma therapy soaking salts excellent for our self care.

And in a very special shout out to Chelsea green publishing the publishing company with whom we’re collaborating in a few different ways. You’ll hear some other episodes throughout the coming months with several of their authors as well.

And a big shout out to our ambassadors who are engaged in such beautiful important work worldwide. And with whom we gather at least monthly online and or in person for ceremony for sharing for inspiration for fellowship.

And if you haven’t become an ambassador and you’d like to join connect in that way, you can go to the page on the website called becoming ambassador and engage in the journey that way.

Of course, we’ve also got our greedy toss society, which is a recent addition where we’re focusing a bit more on the ceremonial, the spiritual, the nature immersion, the wilderness immersion work, the biodynamic land stewardship work.

And this Matthew is at least in my mind and heart very, very connected in a resonant way with the organization that you’ve shared with the world called order of the sacred earth.

And I find when you were speaking about loneliness that I actually experienced this from time to time, it surprises me actually that I can experience loneliness as often as I do, given that the work that I do has me connected with so many amazing folks like yourself doing tremendous things worldwide.

But there are these moments where I do feel this, this kind of disconnection, this kind of loneliness, except when I’m in nature, I don’t, I don’t feel it.

I just don’t when I’m in the woods, when I’m in the forest, when I’m in the wilderness and just came off a multi day excursion with my son, I literally just don’t feel it in that setting Matthew. And I do feel indoors. I do feel it with, you know, the library around me and so forth.

And I’m wondering if you might share any insights you have about that and also, you know, perhaps share with us a bit about what you explore in order of the sacred earth and what you’re sharing with the world through this order that you’ve founded.

Well, I certainly resonate with your feeling of kinship in nature. And I think that the feelings we do have of loneliness of a lot of it may be mother earth reminding us that without an effort at that intimacy that you spoke of.

We are, we are selling ourselves short and we’re going to render ourselves more and more lonely. So, I think this kind of a rhythm going out there, the positive and the negative rhythm that if we deprive ourselves of the foundational relationship with nature and mother earth, including our own nature,

that we’re wandering in a desert kind of loneliness and it’s going to get worse if we, if you’ve not recovered that, the sacredness of nature.

And that takes us to the order of the sacred earth that I think, you know, religions in many parts of the world, in the western part, certainly, are losing a lot of their regular attention.

Attendees, churches are closing and record numbers and so are seminaries and so forth. So, you might ask what’s next.

And it’s my reading of religious history that there have been times, of course, in the past when, while speaking my own Christian tradition, when the church was running out of steam and energy wasn’t, was too involved, too much in bed.

With the current power is the D that were not healthy powers any longer. And what happened was orders happened. So, for example, in the fourth century, the church married the empire and by the fifth century, there was a lot of alienated young people, especially because they were being drafted into the army to kill people in the name of the empire,

supposedly, in the name of Christ or something, while they made a long story story, a long story short. They ran away to the desert and we know them as a desert father, so the desert mothers, but they went into nature in a deep way and said, you know, these humans and these Christian humans are going their way, it’s not my life.

And then, after that, you had this movement of St. Benedict, in fifth century, starting the Benedict and order, which has lasted right up to today. He’ll the Garden of England was a member of that order.

And they were men and women, his sister started a women’s branch. And this really was important, especially during the darkest stages, they kept scholarship alive and educational life and agriculture did a lot of good things.

But, come to 12th century, it was actually a kindergarten century, they were so in bed with a feudal system, which ran everything. And, of course, they were running the education in the religion, that they were going down together because feudalism was failing.

And a new spirit was arising, which included merchants and therefore capitalism. And they were land-based, they were agricultural. And the new movement was much more about travel and seeing other parts of the world, etc.

And so, that is when Francisms, CC and Dominic popped up in the early 13th century. But before them came these communes, young people fled the surf system, the feudal system, they couldn’t get work.

Because families were growing, because the weather patterns had changed in Europe. And you had a longer growing season, so family school, but there wasn’t work for young people.

So, when they go on star short, they fled to towns and overnight these towns became cities. And then you had a new movement, education movement called universities, which were no way connected to the monastic system.

And they were, it came through Islam and scholasticism, which was about asking questions. It was a much more scientific approach to learning.

So, that’s from Francis and Dominic and one started their orders. And then in the 16th century, of course, you had the Protestant Reformation. And I really look at the Protestant Reformation as a series of lay orders, because they were just enchanted by religion, no, the 16th century, which was obviously corrupt in so many ways. And so, these reformers started their own movements.

But you also had in the Catholic Church, Ignatius Leu, who was starting the Jesuits in the late 16th century. So, these are just some examples of Western history. But, of course, realize your orders among Hindus, among Buddhists, and even the Jews had the Ascene movement in the first century and so forth.

So, again, I think the thing about an order, different from a religion, is it can move fast. It can respond to a median. Religion’s like a great big shit. And the bigger it is, the slower it is, and you can’t steer it well, and you certainly can’t start it. You don’t even have breaks.

And so, I think that’s a good thing in order and in religion. And so, orders is freeing up for particular needs, and a particular time.

So, anyway, I had this dream a few years ago, and it was unlike any game I’ve ever had. I woke me up at exactly 4 in the morning, and the dream said, very loudly to me, do it with several exclamation points. That’s the language that woke me up.

To start a new kind of order, that is one ecumenical, doesn’t have any religious ideology dictated to it from behind the scenes, and the curtain.

And that is focused on one issue today, which is saving the earth. And together we would make one vow. I promise to be the best lover of Mother Earth, and the best defender of Mother Earth that I can be.

And so, I spoke to a young man who I know, and it turned out he had had a dream similar. And so, we linked up, and then his girlfriend got involved too.

So, those two, one in their 20s, one in his young 30s, are really the directors of the order. And I’m kind of the elder or something, but because the young people have to carry this.

And the Franciscans and Dominicans, it was the appeal of the vision touched the young people who felt that there was this new vision, this new possibility for healthier religion, the returns of the real teachings of Jesus, and just bypassed centuries of monastic dominance.

So, I think, and so, at our first ceremony, where we took these vows, there were like 80 some people showed up, and there were Protestants of Catholics and Jews, and Indigenous people, and Buddhists, it was actually held in a Buddhist temple in Berkeley.

And at least one atheist came up to you, 26 year old, when she said, I’m an atheist, but I read, were you about, I’m looking for community, this is my values, I’m in this too.

And the brother of Sister Dorothy Staying, who was murdered in the Amazon, he showed up too, from Los Angeles.

So, that was our first vow taking ceremony, and now we have these pads, that’s what we call these different communities around some in North America, some in Peru, and some in Australia, and so forth.

And I just think there’s a potential for this because religion and many respects is failing, but it doesn’t mean, as Deepak Chopper has said, just because people aren’t going to church anymore, doesn’t mean there’s less evil in the world.

The world has not become less evil, there’s still a lot of evil, and there’s still this need for community.

And so, we meet online once a month, and then people are doing their local things, the local, the pod gets together, and they talk about what this means to them, this vow that they take together, how do you apply it in the circumstances, the biovision where you live.

So, I think there’s something very logical about it, but when religion fails, does that mean we have nothing to look to, or do we gather in what previous generation called orders, but strip it down to the basic, and all lifestyles are welcome.

You can be solid, you can be married, you can be gay, you can be straight, that’s another reality of our time.

But the focus is obviously the future of Mother Earth, and I think the fact that the word sacred earth is in the title, because Thomas Barry says, we will not save the earth if we do not see it as something sacred.

That is not enough, it’s just a political agenda, or a moral agenda, that what we’re really talking about here is a more sacred relationship to the earth, and I would use your word again, more intimate.

I think in many ways it would intimate and sacred our sentiments.

Yeah, here, here, so beautiful. I will look forward in our behind the scenes segment, Matthew, asking you a bit more about the order of the sacred earth, and potentially even how we can plant more seeds of collaboration with greedy toss society, and some of the things we’re doing with our ambassadors.

We’ll save that for the behind the scenes segment that we do after our main podcast interview, and for folks who haven’t yet joined our ambassador network, if you’d like to, this is one of the benefits of being an ambassador, you have access to these behind the scenes discussions, as well as other video resources that we offer through the network.

I have a couple of things I will be remiss if I don’t ask you before we conclude our podcast, Matthew, and one is coming from mixed ethnic heritage, myself personally, that includes Mohawk, Native American, along with Celtic, Germanic, Slovenian, etc.

I’ve been in my adult life keen to connect with different indigenous traditions, and I notice, by the way, in your invitation called Employing Spiritual Practices in the Spirit of Illegard, being in the back of your book about her, you lay out a number of activities that we can choose to engage in and cultivate, including sweat lodge.

It struck me that that was included in there, and I’ve noticed that with many of our indigenous traditions, alongside some of our other more mainstream traditions, we’ve got information in wisdom regarding these times we’re living in, sometimes referred to as prophecy.

And, of course, the Hobie people have carried a lot of this as have Mohawk and others, and it blows my mind and my heart really to see and hear and read that Heldigard painted a Hobie-corn mother in her artwork.

Oh, I’ve got my sense of how this is possible, but I’m asking you, how is that possible centuries before Chris Columbus did what he did and all that sort of thing? What is going on here that there’s this connection with her and the Hobie in the 900 years ago?

Well, they say history is written by the winners or whatever, but when his long before Columbus came and made a mess of things, and as the Native Americans tell me, you know, he didn’t discover America, he was lost and he stumbled into America.

And the thought he had discovered it, but he was literally lost. So he ran into it, but the truth is that the, that the Celts came to America along the first months, and they went back to Europe, and first of all, they didn’t, the story things.

They, they didn’t come to redeem the Native people. They didn’t come in to convert them to Christianity. I think they arrived, and together they sat down and talked about the holiness of creation, the sacredness of the earth, and how probably about how they teach their children about the sacredness of creation, and how the others teach theirs, but whatever, but they didn’t make a mess, so we didn’t know they were here.

So they went back, but the fact is that stories were carried on, and he only got raised in a Celtic monastery. She went into the monastery about the age of six.

Well, first she went to a hermitist who was connected, and then she joined the monastery. And the point is that the Celtic legends and lore and stories were alive and well.

And she actually says the first human being was a red man. And she paints, as you say, and you know, you could put this up when you run this.

We could give you the painting, and you could put it up. So we’re talking about this, but it was actually a Native American who went this out to me.

I was showing these slides in a lecture in Santa Fe, and the discussion that Native American said, did you see the hope before mother in her painting?

I said, no, I didn’t, even though I looked at the painting, but it took a Native American to see it. So, you know, I ought to slide up again and sure enough, there are two hopey core mothers in her painting, which is about her own awakening.

There’s the fire coming over her head, like the Pentecost experience with the early disciples that he was applying to her own awakening at the age of 42.

And but she paints these two pillars that she look carefully. They are hopey core mothers, but what a perfect archetype to talk about waking up about resurrection.

And that’s what the hopey core mother means. It looks like it’s bad when the season’s over, but it comes up again. I’m spraying you see.

So it’s a perfect example of the resurrection and of our our participating in awakening and waking up and and so forth.

So, and then there’s another painting where she has what she calls a zealous head of God and God is a red that had his red and there too.

She brings an idea is about the first human being being read. So, made of red earth. So, that’s how Native American woman attuned in to indigenous.

The war 900 years ago that I think that the the akels got to the Americas and brought home some stories and they didn’t even best either sociologically or theologically and no one was killing anybody.

And so they’re forgotten. But they actually are some there is evidence fair again.

It’s a Delaware some stayed up in the Northeast that I visited. You saw some of these monuments that are very much like those in the West Coast of Ireland.

And I think more research has been done on that and more research deserves to be done.

Yeah, again, your monument in is it Rhode Island perhaps is a Rhode Island. Maybe it’s there. I’ve been there but I can’t remember right now. It’s a list.

But I’ve been very blessed to have Native Americans on my faculty.

I’ll go sources of a quota leader who was living in South Carolina but having dreams for 10 years that he should work with white people because white people are running things in the air.

Very smart. That’s what we just get of him is Judy. But he put it off and put it off and put it off and finally the James got more fierce.

And so he looked around and he saw our program in creation spirituality said, well, this might be something I can tolerate.

So my glossary short he drove in his wife out to Oakland from South Carolina and showed up at my door literally at the school and said, I’m here to help you.

My dreams tell me I should and me glossary short he joined the faculty set up a sweat lodge on campus for three years.

And one of the objections to my work by Erna Ratzinger was quote, I work too closely with Native Americans.

I think winning that but that is we had a sweat lodge on a campus in the street.

But it didn’t bring us our staff faculty students. We loved it. We learned so much from it.

And his course is he taught on native spirituality in our program that he went on to third center in the state of Washington.

And I did a vision quest within the year I was silenced. That was a big part of my vision quest.

And and then I joined them for some sun dances and so forth over the years. So anyway, I’ve been very blessed.

I’m just one native teacher because they have to be as a son of a woman and a Franciscan sister. She was on the faculty for years.

She taught me a lot about ritual in our students too.

And and about other things.

And so I’ve been.

Now I’ve attended.

Many powwow’s and of course sweat lodge and so worth of many places.

And they’ve always been very deep blessings for me. I don’t think I would have survived, frankly, without those because the ceremonies are so earthy and cosmic and grounding and bodily.

You just don’t have these in churches where there are questions in her condition and books to read and pages to read from.

You know, you don’t bring your book in purple can do sweat lodge. You bring your heart.

And I first 20 minutes in the sweat lodge, I was sure I was going to die.

I was looking for a fire extinguisher for an exit and there was neither. So finally, I yielded to the experience and asked when you go into another state.

And that’s the whole purpose of fair isn’t it to get.

Get into another state, but you know, I had earlier in the hard way.

Oh, how.

Fable.

How feeble.

Some of our prayer forms are in in the West that we we do have to face death together in a in a prayer circle.

And that changes everything.

I was so struck as invited Sundance, a number of years ago up in the Dakota country in Montana.

We went into the sweat lodge to cool off after that’s in under the sun, which is just bizarre.

There’s such a profound symbolic connection between that ceremonial right and the crucifixion of Jesus.

It blew me away to experience that unexpectedly.

No, it’s not like somebody explained to me ahead of time that there’s this incredible symbolic connection, but it’s there. It’s very real.

Yes, very interesting that you experience that I did too. In fact, in the summer day that we were dancing.

There was the sun with big and white and round and white. It was white.

And I saw it just hit me the native and the Christian.

There was right like a host is in the in the Eucharist liturgy.

And they’re meant as this tree that people are bound to.

And there’s a sack of ice and foul.

The whole thing just got hit me like symbols that the two flat crashed together in a very positive sense for me.

The church that I grew up in was called Blessed Sacrament.

And that is the host, the right host, the name for the white host that became the son.

So I do have that marriage of my Christian archetype, if you will, and the native.

And it is so powerful and real and bodily.

And you don’t forget first things.

No, no, we don’t.

Maybe we’ll pick this threat up in our in our behind the scenes, Matthew.

But before we sign off, I want to ask you about creation spirituality because I believe this is one of the threads running through so many different traditions around the world.

And perhaps one could even make the claim that it’s a thread that runs through all of our ancestral traditions.

It’s just a matter of how far back in time we go to get there.

And I want to quote you from the book, you say, I have devoted my life to recovering the creation spirituality tradition because even though it’s the oldest tradition in the Bible, the tradition of Jesus and the tradition of the greatest mystics of the church, it’s little known.

And my reading of your book on Hildegard with respect to creation spirituality is that this is along with the original instructions.

This is the living original connection, original blessing, original understanding that we can find in all our traditions, Matthew.

I love how you’re reclaiming it and restoring it and really resurrecting it within the context of the Judeo-Christian tradition, particularly where we know we need so much healing.

And I was hoping you could just share a bit with us about your view on creation spirituality.
