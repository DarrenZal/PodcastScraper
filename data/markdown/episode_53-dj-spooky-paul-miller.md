Welcome to the YonEarth Communities Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast Series.

Today we’re in a beautiful garden here in New York City visiting with Paul Miller, also

known as DJ Spooky.

Hey Paul, what’s up man, how you doing?

Great, how you doing?

Excellent.

It’s a muggy, humid day in October.

I just got back in the town and it’s crazy to see that humidity still makes it feel

like you’re in mid-August, I don’t know if you’re in the audience, you can see it’s just

rained recently and it’s very unseasonal for October.

Truly, yeah, driving in we noticed it was 95 degrees in the car coming down the Hudson.

Well, we have some things to talk about clearly with that in mind and before we do let

me just introduce you to the audience here today from the Why On Earth community.

Paul Miller is chief of strategy for global brain and is a composer, multimedia artist,

editor and author.

Paul is the first artist and residence at Google and the first artist and residence at the

Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

This DJ Mixer iPad app has seen more than 12 million downloads in the last year.

He has produced and composed work for Yoko Ono, Thurston Moore and scores of artists

and award-winning films.

Paul’s work as a media artist has appeared in the Whitney Biennial, the Venice Biennial

for Architecture, the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany, Kuntstala Vienna, Austria, the Andy

Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and many other museums and galleries.

His book Sound Unbound published by MIT Press is the best-selling anthology of writings

on electronic music and digital media and, of course, Paul, a lot of the work you’re

doing now is very related to the climate crisis in this global situation that we’re in

as well.

And I thought I just kicked things off by asking you as an artist, a writer, a musician.

How are you connecting the dots to what’s going on with the global climate crisis?

Well, right now is a really interesting crossroads for humanity and what’s amazing is that

on one hand we have, you know, this year 2019 was the 50th anniversary of the landing on

the moon.

It was the 50th anniversary of the creation of the internet and was also the 50th anniversary

of Woodstock.

So 2019 is a crazy year and it’s also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist

China as well, which I was talking about.

So recently in Beijing, they just have this huge march, you know, a sort of hyper-militarized

Chinese kind of nationalism thing going on and it was really fascinating to see how China

has basically become its own kind of ecosystem at every level.

So when I say ecosystem, political, economic, and above all, global, you know, they’re

very focused on global economics.

Meanwhile, in the West, you’ve been seeing a sort of Trump and the sort of rise of nationalism

or white ethnic nationalism and other kinds of variables that really destabilize the idea

of democracy.

So what we’re seeing here is a kind of a critical threshold of both democracy, social justice

and climate justice, all of which are interconnected.

So for me at least, it’s really the next couple of years a very critical kind of ways that

the arts can open up new ways of thinking.

My motto right now is we need better critical thinking and that’s where I think the arts

can really be helpful.

And you’re coming at this with a background in science and you collaborate with scientists

a lot as well.

And I imagine that we have different domains of thinking and really sort of rules of the

game, if you will, and what I hear you advocate for in listening to some of your recent presentations

and talks is that we have to stay focused on this rational discourse as we’re dealing

with these turbulent times.

When you say rational, I actually am a big fan of the irrational.

What’s happening right now is the West really thinks of people as the myth of rationality

was the foundation of modern capitalist consumerism, but people are all hyper-consuming way

more than they need.

So because of that, that they’re driven by advertising and advertising, if you look at

the ecosystems of Facebook and the ecosystem of Google, they’re data mining you, selling

your data and then creating billions dollars industries.

So what’s incredible is that we really have to rethink capitalism.

And that doesn’t mean I’m advocating for people to all wake up and just burn their money

or just, or switch over to cryptocurrency or whatever, but there’s no silver bullet.

While people are entraped by capitalism as a kind of a consumption machine that can make

people aspire to a lifestyle that is unsustainable for the planet.

So you average American waste is something like 80 to 90 pounds of clothes a year and

they literally just thrown away or for that matter, you know, the average American is

not necessarily informed about, you know, global politics or if they throw away a plastic

bag, the plastic bag might be there for 150 years, end up in the middle of the South Pacific,

someplace, etc.

So there’s this kind of layers of complexity and nuance that most people, I mean, I think

people are beginning to realize that there’s a deep amount of time that goes into any human

endeavor, you know, so when you go by, you take the subway for example, yesterday I took

the subway in from LaGuardia because traffic was insane and I didn’t feel like taking

a taxi.

So I’m on the train reading a book, I’m whizzing past all the cars stuck and traffic

on the VQE, you can see in the distance there’s this huge gridlock.

And our cities aren’t made for cars for example, nor are like daily lives, I mean, but

people, you know, these are, that’s just one variable, cars, fast fashion, crops that

are mono crops that sort of deplete soil, these are all things that go into the production

of mass society, mass culture.

So these are things I’m trying to kind of give people to rethink.

And how does that show up in your art?

Right now, I’m a big fan of what I call tools for critical thinking.

So when people think of art, they usually think of like a painting on the wall or sculpture

or this or that.

I think a good conversation to be art, which is like what we’re having now, or for that

matter, there’s this kind of ephemerality that sampling and collage and DJ culture kind

of uses as a basic foundation.

And most kids are growing up with that kind of social media meets music kind of context

of soundclouds, Spotify and so on.

So one could argue that it’s like a massive social sculpture.

And those are things that I’m kind of thinking about as we transition into 2020 with the year

coming up.

So massive social sculpture, that’s an amazing concept.

How do we, how do we plug and play with that?

How do you see that playing out in 2020?

Well, I mean, what’s been fascinating right now is like, there’s a term called murmuration.

And so when you see it, like I’m sure many people see this where you see an entire flock

of birds switching on diamond, they’re all following each other.

And the birds are actually navigating using the arithmetic field.

They’re also making a mathematical structure of them entire flock.

So if you ever see birds, they’re kind of, they’re flying in usually a geometric form.

So two with humans, except our flocking mechanisms are social media.

You can quantify that and see how people relate, click, like, and so on, which of course

is what the foundation of most of these Amazon, Facebook, and so on.

That’s what they’re doing.

But how is that art, which is fascinating, because like we’re now, those are, we’re in

a data-driven society.

And that data that we’re generating and giving away for free is being optimized for machine

learning and other kinds of things.

So how you turn that into art is kind of a fascinating moment.

So I’m a big fan of what you call data visualization.

So I took a studio to Antarctica a while ago and made a series of music composition pieces

based on weather.

And right now, what I’m doing at Google is we’re looking at the Saharan Desert, which

is in radical transformation right now because of the growth of different airstreams over

the Sahel and the Saharan Desert are changing.

And the fact deserts are growing, in fact, many people are noticing that the deserts

are growing to the north.

So we’re taking some of that weather patterns and turning that into music compositions.

And those are just projects, but again, they’re very specific with that data based initiative.

So if any of our audience wants to check any of this work out, where’s the best place

online to do that?

The best place is just my website, it’s djschoolheat.com.

And there’s different subsites on the site.

One is the easiest to remember is djschoolheat.com slash Antarctica.

But there’s plenty of other stuff.

The Google product will be on my website in about two weeks.

Great.

And because we don’t publish in real time, two weeks maybe in the past, maybe in the

future, we shall see.

Oh, there’s a great joke.

I forget the stand up comedian who like to say, hey, someone came up to him and said,

I want to show you a picture from when I was younger.

And he pauses and he says, all pictures are from when we were younger.

So we’ll see how that all ties out.

But we’ll probably publish around the time that that is live on your site as well, the

Sahara project.

And of course, we know that there are now mobilizing at the local level, the regional

level, the national level, even the multinational level, efforts to build soil, reforist and afforist

all around the deserts, the goby, the Sahara, et cetera.

And so as you’re gathering some of this mega global data for art and artistic expression,

there are also folks on the ground working to halt the advances of the deserts and ultimately

the hope and the intent is to reverse that.

Yeah, no, the deserts, right now the star of the show is the oceans because everyone’s

kind of really tightly focused on oceans and reforistation.

But I think deserts are the hidden variable that’s really going to be causing a tremendous

amount of Veil people.

So I’ll give you a quick example, which is where everyone’s complaining about refugees,

not complaining, but just realizing refugees will be one of the most destabilizing forces

in the next 15 to 20 years as we move further into climate change.

The borders that were drawn by Europe in the 19th century, most of which were in Africa,

you know, because of various treaties, or you have stuff like the Sykes-Pico agreement

after World War I that set up the borders of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and so on.

All those borders are drawn by the collapse of the British Empire and on top of that,

the kind of European colonial initiatives that between the two wars.

Most of the major conflict areas are exactly in those regions because people were put in

the nation-state that were fictional.

But then on top of that, if you’re looking at Libya and its relationship to Italy or

the refugees going through the Mediterranean, they’re all fleeing basically semi-failed

nation-states.

And those nations are semi-failed because climate change is destabilized and disrupted

all of their abilities to grow crops and to be able to have a sustainable process that’s local.

So too with Honduras and all the Guatemala, you know, a lot of the people that are fleeing

to the border in the US are also coming out of Central America where they’ve had droughts

and other things going in Northern Bolivia.

A lot of farms have been destabilized as well.

So climate refugees then trigger right-wing lunatics because they may always need a bogeyman.

So if you look at the 1930s in Europe, you know, the idea of purity or being able to create

a project of nationalism that was one of the main triggers of World War II.

We’re right in that powder-cag moment again.

I think if you look at what’s been going on in Brazil, what’s been going on in Central Europe,

America obviously in Japan,

there’s these leaders that are optimizing for nationalism because it helps them consolidate power.

So mobilizing hate and fear.

Yeah, hate and fear.

Which generally, if you’re…

That’s where you’re getting to a crisis of democracy, right in the custom of climate change as well.

Right.

I’m just making a quick note here.

So I want to come back this notion of this massive social sculpture.

That’s such an amazing concept in term.

What are you envisioning?

And what are some of the events you’ll be creating in 2020?

What are some of the things folks can be thinking about or looking out for?

Well, the reason I use the term social sculptor is because we have to really think about impermanence and femberality.

Those are going to be really fascinating components of rethinking capitalism.

So generally, capitalism aspires to permanence and market forces trying to squeeze as much value as a short term thinking.

So most people, businesses and stuff, they’re looking at a lot of profit and loss and so on.

But a social sculpture means me and you are creating a structure.

There’s an artist named Joseph Boyce who was really popular in the 1960s.

He was a big inspiration for me.

And there’s more current artist like Olifer Eliasin, who’s really fascinating.

He has a retrospective at the Tape Modern in London right now, where he’s been doing quite a bit about environmental activism.

But those are just two different examples.

Joseph Boyce or Olifer Eliasin.

But for me, a sculpture is something that is a form.

Like somebody has put solid objects in place, they usually put it out in a pedestal.

But if you’re thinking about a different kind of sculpture, it’s about an idea.

It’s a form, but it’s a form of thought.

So that’s why I’m saying social sculpture because people can then create new shapes and new forms.

One of my favorite books when I was a kid was Edwin Abbott’s book Flatlands.

Where this dot is in the middle of a two-dimensional field, and then the sphere comes down, and says,

then the dot feels like you can see everything.

And then as long as you have overview of that different dimension,

so Edwin Abbott’s book was called A Romance of Many Dimensions.

Him, Lewis Carroll, you know, they’re artists of thinking.

Like there’s a couple other books that will change your idea about perspective.

Like Douglas Hofstetter’s book Goldal Escherbach.

Is a really good one.

So I try and think about it as the overview effect of everyday life.

The overview effect is about when you leave Earth and you can actually see the great blue marble in the distance.

You realize we’re all in one planet. There’s no borders.

And that means it’s a pan-humanist kind of thing.

And all those nation-state borders are just fiction somebody drew on a map someplace.

So that’s what I think in the better world right now.

What I mean in the world, I mean in the political world, not just geography.

We have a more enlightened approach to thinking about climate refugees and how they destabilized

clinical and nation-states.

But it’s probably going to get more harsh and weirder of a next couple of decades.

Because people still have the romance of the nation-state, like the board.

That’s what the right wing keeps saying.

The borders there isn’t that.

But if you look at what all these people are fleeing, it’s mainly the common denominator is climate change.

I mean that’s a huge component.

We had an interesting conversation earlier today with Jonathan Granoff,

who works with Nobel Peace laureates worldwide about the creation of the nation-states

in the 17th century in Europe.

And he had a very similar commentary.

And I’m so struck that the digital communication technology is enabling a rapidly emerging global society

where increasingly many of us, whether scientists, artists, farmers, all of the above,

are thinking about refugees and concerned about the fate and plight of people all around the world right now.

And we know that we’re dealing with 60 million, perhaps 65 or more,

million refugees currently, the greatest number since the end of the Second World War.

Our friends in the CIA, the intelligence, the defense communities are dealing with projections

that make that an order of magnitude greater in our lifetime, quite possibly.

And so this is a severe and serious existential crisis for all of us

when you have that degree of dislocation.

My hope is that artists like you and thought leaders like you can help plant the seeds,

spread the thought forms, the form of thought we call sculpture to help mitigate that

and so that we don’t end up in those scenarios.

Well, I mean, this is where you’re at across roads.

I think our species is being driven into kind of like this paradox

because capitalism requires ever-expanding markets, growth of markets,

sort of addiction to growth.

So we’re always consuming more and more and more and more.

And then other people around the world are looking at that, especially China,

the American consumer model, is like we’d need two or three earths just to satisfy.

If everyone on this planet lived like an American, you know,

but meanwhile, the geopolitical issues are like very clear.

I mean, we’re in a hyper-militarized culture, most of the devices we use,

the internet itself, wasn’t the military system as well.

So these are all things that we have to be, I think, clear and aware of.

But if you look at any social movement that’s caused to a change,

I’ll give you one example, Susan B. Anthony and the Women’s Suffrage of Movement.

I’m a huge fan of that was non-violent, Mahatma Gandhi, all these people

who said we can’t take it anymore, but they didn’t take it into some sort of huge revolution

or like Marx or Stalin or, you know, instead they said we need a peaceful, non-violent change

to change the way people live.

And that’s, again, shaping a new sculpture, shaping a new form.

But this society itself, you know, is kind of…

And that’s where global culture really has potential to change a wave in the American hyper-consumption model.

I mean, I’d give us five to ten years if we really, really can’t get that, you know,

changing the course of the Titanic.

The iceberg isn’t an iceberg, it’s a meteorite, you know, like we are the meteorite at this point.

So if you think about the metaphor of changing the course of the Titanic,

it’s like we’re rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic right before it hits this huge…

Well, now the iceberg is going to be all melted, so we’d have to…

A different metaphor.

Yeah, different metaphor, but…

What I find so compelling about the Titanic metaphor is that there were many people aboard that ship

who were absolutely convinced that ship could not sink.

Absolutely, even after it struck ice.

What does that tell us?

Well, there’s a couple of theories about that where having a belief that you know is false is fascinating.

Especially with the era of Trump and, you know, sort of the Fox News demographic

that you cannot reason with them, you cannot present them with facts, you cannot say that every scientist has agreed to…

Except for maybe 2.0% of like scientists would say that climate change is happening and humans are the cause.

98.9, maybe.

But people still won’t, you know, the climate deny kind of demographic.

It’s mostly emotional.

You know, they don’t really think about facts in a way that you can present a clear cut case, connect.a.b.c.

You know, yes.

So we need new tools to kind of bypass that demographic.

Because eerily enough, the Fox News demographics generally over the age of 50, generally over even 60.

And they’re the prime Trump demographic that’s…

They’re blocking our tremendous amount of stuff and leading our species to extinction.

You know, just…

If we don’t play our cars right, the planet will be here when everyone says, oh, we need to save the planet.

I’m like, no, the planet’s the most resilient system we have access to.

The problem is we would need to save ourselves because we’ve then disrupted all of the patterns of the planet.

So these people, you cannot reason whether you cannot show math to you, you cannot show data, facts, anything.

You know, you need to hit in a different dimension around their points of resistance.

So, you know, one of my favorite things as we do the Y on Earth community mobilization work all around the country,

we’re working with all kinds of demographics, all kinds of people.

And what I have found is that everyone relates to soil and to this notion of growing food.

And we have memories of grandparents and great grandparents gardening if we don’t do that yet ourselves again.

And it’s something that really is common ground in so many respects.

And it gives me some hope and we have tremendous challenges.

But it gives me some hope there are themes and memes we can be working with and working on that reach across some of these incredibly challenging divides that we’re facing right now.

Well, that’s where I think when people say social justice or climate justice, those are things that really are dear to my heart.

And none of the issues right now are about this notion of what is privilege.

So a lot of people will say, okay, why privilege is this or the idea that most people who are going to be hammered by climate change are in the poorer countries that never produce the main components of what’s causing the problem.

And women and children to boot on top of that.

By the way, can I get another cup of tea?

Thank you.

Let me take the opportunity to just thank George and Dusty.

We’re here at the Westview News offices in the village in New York City.

And we’re working or cooking up some collaborations with these wonderful folks.
