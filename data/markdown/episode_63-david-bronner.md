Welcome to the YonEarth Community’s Stewardship and Sustainability podcast series.

Today we are visiting with David Bronner, hey David.

Hey, thanks for having me.

Yeah, it’s great to have you really excited about our conversation today.

Right, right on, thank you.

So David Bronner is CEO or Cosmic Engagement Officer of Dr. Bronner’s, the top selling brand

of natural soaps in North America, and producer of a range of organic body care and food products.

He is a grandson of company founder, a manual Bronner, and a fifth generation soap maker.

Under David and his brother, Michael’s leadership, the brand has grown from $4 million in sales in 1998

to over $122 million in annual revenue in 2018.

David was born in Los Angeles, California in 1973 and earned an undergraduate degree in biology from Harvard University.

David and Michael established Dr. Bronner as a sustainable leader in the natural products industry

by becoming one of the first body care brands to formulate with hemp seed oil in 1999

and to certify its soaps, lotions, bombs, and other personal care products under the USDA National Organic Program in 2003.

Both actions resulted in high profile litigation with government agencies, D.E.A. and USDA respectively,

that Dr. Bronner’s ultimately won, cementing Dr. Bronner’s activist orientation in the natural products marketplace.

Over the years, David and Dr. Bronner’s have been key leaders in fights for GMO labeling,

industrial hemp farming in the United States, high bar organic and bear trade standards, cannabis reform, and a fair minimum wage.

Today, David is helping to lead the effort to establish the regenerative organic certified standard,

dedicating time and resources to creating an integrated comprehensive program that addresses soil health, animal welfare,

and fair labor practices to advance sustainable and ecological alternatives to industrial agriculture.

Dr. Bronner’s partners in certified fair trade projects to source all major ingredients, including olive oil from Palestine and Israel,

coconut oil from Sri Lanka, peppermint oil from India, and sustainable palm oil from Ghana.

So, David, it is such a joy to have this opportunity to visit with you, and clearly Dr. Bronner’s has become one of the global leaders

in developing sustainable and regenerative supply chains throughout the world.

And I was thinking as a way to dive in, we might just start by asking you why bother with all of this?

What is it that’s motivating you? Clearly, you could have taken Dr. Bronner’s in a number of different directions.

Yeah, right on. Well, I guess we got to start with my grandad, Dr. Bronner.

His source passion was, well, he himself was the generation German-Jews filmmaker.

His grandad was something to manual.

At first, he began so manufacture in 1858, the small southern German town of Loweheim.

The grandad came of age and got out really poor in the last century.

And he came up, and by the time in the 20s, when he was apprentice to another so-making family,

his dad and two of the running family operations, we had a really big factory in Loweheim,

another southern German town, pretty much one of the biggest so-bakers in Germany.

And my grandad had, you know, he basically got a map, the equivalent of a master.

So a master, a chemistry master, so maker.

And so I had a family enterprise, but early on was pretty activist.

He was very zymist and political.

And his dad and uncles were kind of like, you know, like, please don’t knock the boat, you know.

It wasn’t Naziism and then fascism.

The Metro dimensions were not apparent in the late 20s, but it was just still, you know,

just a time of unrest.

And just, I mean, I get out a lot of ideas on things so making it.

Just repeatedly clashing with his dad and uncles.

It just became over the age of 21 in 1929 and landed in the Chicago Milwaukee area.

It became a consultant in the US open industry, like PNGs of the world,

helped design factories and launch products.

And I met his wife and married and I had to be children by the 30s.

And over the course of this time, he became increasingly desperate with the right to pillar to get his family out.

And his two sisters got out, one ended up in it.

He lives in Israel, a lot in Louisiana.

His middle sister, I came over to the States.

And she got out in 38 right before the borders were closed.

But his parents, like a lot of police law Jews, that they were going to write out the madness.

And unfortunately, the fact that her hearing eyes in the 1940s, they were reported and killed for the answer.

So in his time, his wife, Paula, my dad’s mom, I went out with two, I took sick leave.

And so my grandmother was just dealing with immense tragedy.

And somehow in the midst of this, she was having these mystical experiences,

the one that’s in the love of the heart of reality.

You know, clearly saw that all the fake traditions were at their heart,

pointing at this transcendent mystery of love, that even in a world of suffering and absurdity,

tragedy that if humanity could realize our transcendent unity,

and that we’re all children of the same divine and source,

then embrace across religious and ethnic divides,

that we could have burnt a nuclear catastrophe,

which you saw, the next holocaust, we didn’t figure this out.

We were going to solve parish.

So he went forth around the country, lecturing on his peace plan.

We call them YVC.

And it was a bit of the ecological pioneer here, the onslaught,

like this industry in a post forward to the era,

moves increasing to a petrochemical basis,

pesticides into sets that fertilizers and everything coming out of the war effort,

we’re starting to be applied to our two crops,

and in personal care, you know, natural social and above,

we became petrochemical-based factors for shampoo and body care,

and yearly onslaught a problem of making this move

and the damage of the environment.

So, you know, he stayed true to what we had become,

kind of an old-fashioned soap recipes of his family.

And as he went around the country, lecturing,

he would sell the soap on the side.

And then we got out that this was pretty dang good soap.

And people were coming to get the soap without necessarily sticking around

to what he had to say.

So, he began to download what he had to say on a label.

So, our label now has the more YVC, like 3,000 words on each port,

just kind of downloading his vision of peace and unity and love.

Kind of the one love, the one true religion of love,

it’s a heart of all the faith traditions,

and you know, seeing that, you know,

when you don’t make fundamentals, beliefs,

and you make, you know, food way,

that it all is that same, same, mysterious love

that’s just way beyond any of us.

And so, with the rise of the counter-culture

and, you know, the recognition and rejection of corporate America

and the war machine and the era of silence,

and you know, all of the growing understanding of the damage

and the ecological catastrophe we were flipping on the environment

through our industries and agricultural practices,

and industrial agriculture, in particular,

means that’s a massive harm to the earth.

So, with the rise of the counter-culture,

they really embraced the soap that was concentrated in versatile,

great able, you could wash your hair, your kid, your dog,

your kids shoes, let us start the river, and don’t worry about it.

So, you can’t really, you know,

become the iconic soap of the era.

And, but he always, you know,

he always kind of saw the, you know, after business grew.

I mean, for him, it was a nonprofit religious organization.

It was not, I mean, it was the business very much

was sort of the all-envisioned.

And eventually, he lost the IRS in the late 80s

to disagree with those tax exempt status,

and we were forced into bankruptcy,

and my dad, who actually, he had his own business,

and I actually grew up working with my dad’s business.

My dad oversaw the soap production up in LA.

He didn’t, my dad moved down here to San Diego,

or kind of San Diego, in the early 60s.

But, so I grew up in LA.

My dad oversaw it was a large chemical manufacturing operation

and oversaw the production of the soap.

He also developed things like firefighting foam

for forest and structure fires.

And I grew up selling firefighters and using foam

for my dad and just following my dad around,

which is now standard on most fire trucks

like the rest of our foam system for a structure of forest fires.

But, so my dad and mom and my uncle basically

came, my granite got Parkinson’s,

and so my granite basically retired.

And my dad and mom and uncle,

and I kind of righted the ship,

fired a lot of bad advisors,

so we got a terrible advice.

We actually did many groups, he has four profit,

but we always had a non-profit,

dealing with the heart of what we’re about.

So, you know, fast forward,

I guess, so my granddad,

you know, I went through a lot after college,

I graduated in 1995,

and went to Amsterdam.

I had some really mega-seconded experiences.

It really opened me up,

just kind of tied into the light and love

with the heart of reality.

And realized that what had really been selling it,

sailing over my head from my granddad,

pretty much my whole life,

also made perfect sense of it.

It was like, wow, you know, he’s been honored,

he’s been talking about this whole time,

and you know, growing up, it was a lot.

You know, it’s like the most unique dispassion bird,

you know, it was just a lot to deal with,

but now all of a sudden it was like, oh my god,

it’s like so hot, so I’m going.

And also this is a time of like,

just recognizing the disaster Western civilization

and just the alienation from nature

and the insecurity we feel in a deep way,

that we compensate it with like material consumption

and domination,

and just the way we’re just shredding and treating nature

as just like resource to extract stuff

and make stuff.

And you know, just seeing that the damage

we’re reading all these ecological systems

in collapse and communities being shredded

around the world,

and I adopted a big idea

at that time as well.

It came back and it took a little bit for me to join

up with a family company when it was a mental health counselor

for it,

but eventually decided I wanted to,

my ex-wife, Chris,

a missing woman who’s now running a portion of her account,

her condition focused on trafficking and refugee issues.

We were, she had pregnant

and I had to sort of think in about the long term,

and I had gotten to the point where I was ready to work

with my dad.

You know, it was one of the things I had to cause,

it was something I had to use like a dollar

or my family company.

But, you know, as I’m sure you realize,

wow, if a company like Dr. Browns

were off a new job,

I’d go for a second.

So, let my dad know that

in my art,

Otter was born on March 7, 1997,

the same data Dr. Brungard died.

So, they’re kind of high-fiving in and out.

And surely after my dad was diagnosed with stage for lung cancer

and given six months.

And of course, when I made that decision,

the company accommodated the family business.

And we had an amazing year together.

We really doubted the ropes

and set the up for some of the sadest.

But when I came in,

it was like very,

much vowing.

You know,

Dr. Brungard died.

Dr. Brungard died.

Dr. Brungard died.

And the other things we did

is put in a five-new one compensation cap.

So, no matter how big the business got,

no executive would make more than five times

of those paid warehouse position.

So, you know,

you can just see how things were going

and just a way,

you know,

just so many people

just started buying yons and bigger houses and cancer cars.

You know, like,

we were just like,

no, it’s not going to happen here.

And we’re going to run this in a way

that liberates more and more profits to help drive

our partner projects.

And, you know,

and as I came in the industry,

I mean, one of the first things we did was

was incorporate an emcee oil into the liquid soaps.

And emcee oil was with a high and I make a three,

which is a triple unsaturated, triple double bond fatty acid.

That’s essential for helping our mind function.

But in a cosmetic product,

it’s very smooth.

You made our lather.

Well, it rolls like a weed.

You’ll need a lot of pesticides and fertilizers to grow it

versus things that cotton take as a huge amount of herbicide.

But then it’s also positioned in the drug war,

just really showing the absurdity in the entire area

of the drug war.

So out of control,

it was scheduling a non-drug every cultural crop.

It was a schedule one substance.

It was a way for us to kind of engage on that

and just start to shift the loss in this country

and start having a much more rational pro policy.

That’s what it now.

We had a lot of adventures.

We were fighting D.E.A.

A lot.

But, you know, in 2018,

with the Farm Bill,

we finally fully legalized that farming.

In the…

Sustainable agriculture.

Not, you know, I mean, back when I was like,

oh, yeah, this is a solution, everything.

But, you know, over time,

you were just meeting brands like Waikki,

or your Ramati brand.

It’s going to be integrated.

All their, all their your Ramate is produced in, you know,

in the rainforest,

but the Waikki tribe,

in a totally sustainable way.

And they go to market and partnership with their suppliers

and they’re not hitting farming communities

around the world against each other.

And that equal exchange

and other fair trade companies.

You know, we were,

for I was inspired to, you know,

just realize like,

wow, I have no idea

where our coconut oil is coming from.

I mean, we’re buying from brokers like everybody else,

on price and stock.

We know visibility to the growing conditions,

social conditions,

environmental conditions.

So, in realizing that,

whatever coolness we’re doing here in headquarters,

where we’re manufacturing the soap,

we have 10 times more in impact, you know, supply chains,

and our agricultural supply chains.

This is so much more people,

farmers, workers involved,

so much more land involved.

So, what we’re doing in a supply chains matter,

in a way a lot more than what we’re doing here,

out that we should be taking care of our own house.

But really taking care of your,

taking responsibility for your supply chains is crucial.

And we realized that, you know,

the first thing we needed to do was go organic, you know,

like just realizing the disaster,

conventional industrial agriculture,

you know, just all this synthetic fertility,

and pesticides,

and poisoning of farm workers,

and the farmers,

and your ecosystems,

and that, you know,

we needed to farm that,

in a way that replicates nature,

you know, look at a forest,

there’s no chemical inputs,

it’s all self regenerating.

How does our farming

and the system replicate that?

So, you know, we went on a big long adventure

to figure that out,

and then also realizing that organic,

because it ended up itself,

addressed the social conditions.

You know, generally it’s better,

but sometimes not,

and you really need a fair trade,

it’s some kind of certified body to just make sure that, you know,

farmers,

well, we can make sure the prices are being paid right,

but to make sure the workers are,

that’s translating to the workers,

and all that.

So, we were dual sort of,

about organic and fair trade,

but the part of the fair trade really was,

just in promoting,

best regenerative organic practices,

I tell you,

who’s deals with compost

and mulching,

and, you know,

over time,

you just, like,

really got good at figuring out,

and most of our agriculture supply,

our raw materials are,

from perennial tree crops,

so coconut, palm,

olives,

and so, you know,

what is the best

agricultural regenerative approach,

and realizing that,

it’s really about intercropping, you know,

in an annual system,

it’s about a smart rotation, you know,

maybe it’s on your rotation,

and it’s on the explosion,

crops,

and you’re making sure

you’re,

you’re suppressing nitrogen,

and, you know,

not over-telling soil,

and all that.

But in a perennial system,

it’s more about intercropping,

complimentary species

that could be a bit of forest,

you’ve got tall trees,

mid-level trees,

bushes, and ground cover,

when you look at a cropping system,

so, if you can take,

for example,

and gone on our palm,

and palm is such a destructive crop,

so, you know,

hemp is a symbol of all that’s good,

and palm is a symbol of all that’s bad,

you know,

it’s generally grown on,

in this horrible way,

that these corporate lentations

are ripping up rainforest,

just doing a rainy thing out with that,

communities be shredded,

wetlands,

just, you know,

all this carbon in the wetland,

oxidizing out of the sphere.

there’s nothing inherent about palm,

it’s bad,

and it’s just the management system.

If you take a regenerative management approach,

it’s actually really great crop,

because it’s very efficient,

producing oil.

And what we’re doing is,

we’re working with small holders,

and gone on,

they’re intercropping

with toco,

banana and cassava,

and that’s basically replicating,

you get the tall palm trees,

you get the little,

cocoa and banana,

and then the ground covered,

it’s a cassava.

if you were to take the same area,

and do monoculture blocks,

it would be to those,

versus,

I’ve been,

a smart, dynamic,

inner planning,

you understand that,

how the economy is going to fill in,

you’re doing a lot of pruning.

You’re going to double the yields.

You’ll have double the biomass,

double the yields,

just requesting a whole lot more carbon,

and you,

you see so much more,

you’re generating a whole lot more income

so yeah,

so that’s,

you know, basically,

you know,

we do leverage our profits externally

for a lot of other causes,

but we feel like,

you know,

for some of us important,

is really just making sure that,

you know,

our headquarters

and then,

and our staff here,

and then all of,

the farmers and workers involved

in our supply chains

that take care of them,

you know,

if everybody did that,

that we would start to really,

you know,

solve,

like some of the huge problems,

you know,

the kind of change

in environmental,

the kind of change

in ecological catastrophe,

generally,

if, you know,

if businesses,

and then, as consumers,

take responsibility,

for making correct choices,

and, you know,

the analogy,

you know,

and I’ve come to see myself

in solidarity

with high animal welfare,

pasture-based life-sauk,

ranches, grass-fedded,

you know,

it’s all about any lesson

that I’m making,

and making those choices,

and, you know,

or plant-based diet,

as I’ve chosen,

but looking at your place

of farm

and you fork is a pitch for it and knife is a butchering knife, what does your farm look like?

What is your section of the garden look like? Are you supporting a farmer who can really take

out a land and the people and the animals? It just looks amazing on the orders that look like a

monoculture desert disaster. And that’s as that causes his pervade, that we can really

terraform the earth, right? Everybody starts choosing this. One-third of the earth’s surface is

under rough farm and rainland management and you’ll rather some high tech solution. All we need

to do is just choose which area we’re getting and just start to really shift and make our farming

emphasis systems. Revitalize rural economies, make friendly habitat for wildlife. Just take

care of the farmers and workers and make heaven on earth. Along with decarbonizing the economy,

we’ve got to do that too. That’s absolutely beautiful, David. Boy, there’s so much that you’re

sharing with us and I really appreciate it. I want to circle back to one of your earlier comments

regarding your grandfather. It’s making me think when my grandpa was still alive, he

gardened, he was an organic gardener and he was a prisoner of war in World War II. He was on

the black bar. You just barely survived that experience. And afterward he had such a grounded

and simple spiritual approach to life and he understood that good soil and good clean quality

food was essential. And I remember as a kid talking with him about that and as I grew up

recognizing that this industrial chemical-based agriculture was insanity. He was madness. He was

one in the family who said, you’re absolutely right. And he had a perspective that helped me

understand that what had been normalized over the last several decades was actually a massive

aberration and to use your keyword here. It was a disaster and is a disaster and I’m so struck

by your influence from your grandpa and I’m just curious if you might share with us before we dive
