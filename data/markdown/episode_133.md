Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry, and this

is our 133rd episode. I thought, given the special nature of this number, which I’ll

share with you a little later on in the episode, it would be an opportune time, perhaps even

an auspicious time, to come out you directly and share a number of reflections and updates,

having now published 132 episodes and making this our 133rd. We’ve had the opportunity

to interview so many thoughtful and impactful authors and scientists, indigenous wisdom

keepers, farmers, herbalists, executives, youth activists, and myriad others who are engaged

one way or another in what we like to call the regeneration renazons. I’ll tell you a bit

about how we’ve been framing the regeneration renazons as well, as it really encompasses

virtually all aspects of our human experience and doings on planet earth in these momentous

times. Got so many new resources to share with you as well and updates on a number of really

exciting projects in development that will be rolling out in the coming weeks and months.

So maybe to dive in, I’ll share with you that as you probably can tell by the background

if you’re watching the video and perhaps here by the the raindrops if you’re listening

that it’s a rainy day. And no, I’m not currently in the Pacific Northwest, although this

kind of weather certainly takes me back to my early childhood and roots where I froliced

in the woods for hours in that incredibly lush and fertile part of the world. No, this

is actually Colorado, not too far from Elk Run Farm and the town aligns the city of Boulder

and a little farther away to larger city of Denver. Just up in the foothills here and we’re

having an usually wet rainy several days, which is most welcome for many of our farming

and gardening friends, getting the soils, the plants, the starts, freshly planted a really

good drink of mama gaias nourishing waters. And a shout out, speaking of Elk Run Farm,

a big shout out to Nick DiDominico and Marissa Pulaski who run the farm and run drylands

agro ecology research. And they in partnership with our friends, Audrey, Wycoff and others

at the yellow barn farm nearby actually planted some 10,000 trees in partnership with the

one tree planted organization and several others converging hundreds of folks getting together

to plant thousands of trees to help restore, regenerate the landscapes. And that’s one

of the three major pillars that we think about when we’re doing our regeneration renaissance

work. We’ve got the ecology, which includes agriculture, includes taking good care of

soil and water and plants and trees, our environments. We’ve also got culture. And this of course

includes how we interact with each other. And I’ll be speaking a little more about that,

sharing some of the insights and learnings I’ve had over the last several weeks and months

with our podcast guests and other collaborating individuals and organizations. And in addition

to culture, we also have economy. We have the machinery, the machinations, the design,

the architecture, if you will, of our economic and financial systems. And when we’re engaged

deeply in this regeneration work, we come to understand that all three of those ecology,

culture and economy are so intimately interconnected, especially right now for our species in particular

having such a profound impact on the living biosphere of planet earth and of course on one

another. For better or worse, in many cases it’s worse than it could be. We’ll speak to that

a little bit as well. So I’m out here enjoying this beautiful rainy day. And I’ve been very thoughtful

in preparation for this 133rd episode to share with you in a way that allows me to perhaps open up a

little more than I often do when I’m interviewing another guest and share some of my not only thoughts

but feelings and perhaps even some of the more vulnerable aspects of some of the thoughts and feelings

that I’ve had as of late and have from time to time doing this kind of work.

As I mentioned Nick and Marissa, I got to mention too that we of course had two beautiful podcasts

with them, one with each, the his and hers episodes last fall at Elk Run Farm when the gardens were in full

bountiful bloom just before a few weeks before. In fact, we got our first

frosts and snows and knocked that back for the winter months. And of course now a spring time and

we’ve just come through the season of belting the eclipses that occurred.

And recording this right around the time of Mother’s Day, it’s such a wonderful time to

give thanks for the fertility, the fecundity, the abundance we experience on this planet especially

come spring time. Whether we’re in the northern or the southern hemisphere, we have a spring time on

an annual seasonal basis. And in the northern hemisphere it’s spring right now and just a great time

to reflect and deepen into our awareness of our gratitude and even our love for the living planet

we get to appreciate and enjoy. And of course that gives us life.

And I think gratitude and love are really at the core of all this work that we’re doing.

And I find that the cultivation of love and gratitude is fundamentally the

task at hand, the work we have before us. Regardless of our other areas of inquiry and perhaps

expertise and that endeavor, regardless of whether we’re working in the realm of technology

or finance or farming or herbal medicine or another holistic modality for healing

or some other professional pursuit, we all, I believe, have the opportunity in all of this at this

time to really deepen into our practices of cultivating on a daily basis this deep love and

gratitude. And so with that, I’ll glance at my notes from time to time and just make sure that I

share with you the things that I wanted to share with this episode. And I brought a handful of

books and some of the very special partner products that we have in our ecosystem of collaboration

for you. And maybe I’ll start there and mention that we now got such a beautiful

partnership with Chelsea Green Publishing and they are a fabulous boutique press working with

a number of authors engaged in this regenerative work from farming and gardening to working with

food and also around economics and culture. We just recently had the opportunity to interview

Ben Raskin with his Winship Handbook and that episode will be coming out relatively soon,

so keep your eye out for that. That was just a wonderful discussion about how we can all

incorporate Winships into our gardening and farming efforts. Roy Seibag’s new book The Natural Order

of Money is Hot Off the Press from Chelsea Green. And by the way, you can get a 35% discount on all

the Chelsea Green books and audio books through the yhonourth.org website through the partners

and supporters page you’ll see a number of our collaborating partners you can click right through

and go shopping at a great discount from our friends at Chelsea Green or just use the code

yoe35 at ChelseaGreen.com and you can get the books there. So yeah, this upcoming chat with Roy

about the natural order of money is going to be wonderful and we’ve also got a chat coming up

with Maria Rodale. Love, nature and magic and I’m really looking forward to this episode. It’s

such a joy to have begun reading her beautiful book and of course she comes from a family that’s

had tremendous impact in the organic and regenerative farming and land stewardship movement. Her

grandfather apparently coined the term organic farming and her father as I understand it

coined the term regenerative farming and so this is a beautiful, beautiful work of love from Maria

sharing some of her insights with her very personal and intimate relationships with different

plants in her garden. So that’ll be a great one to share and we’ve also had the opportunity to

interview some other wonderful folks like Georgia Kelly for instance who runs an annual excursion

to the Mondragon cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain and coming up in September is the

next trip. There are still a couple of spots available. I’m planning to go and the Mondragon

cooperatives in case you’re not aware are one of the most important examples of what regenerative

economics can look like at scale founded in the 1950s. It has blossomed into an organization that

includes something around 90,000 worker-owner members and as a conglomerate of different businesses

democratically and worker-owned democratically governed and worker-owned they’re now doing

somewhere in the vicinity of $25 billion a year in sales and have a beautiful educational arm,

a beautiful agriculture arm, a land stewardship climate response work is coming there,

culinary school, all kinds of things. So really looking forward to sharing the episode with

Georgia Kelly with you and if you want to join and have some time in September to make an excursion

over to Europe or if you’re already in Europe and want to meet up with us there, get in touch and

we’ll save you a spot if there’s one still available. We’ve also had the opportunity to interview

Bishop Palos, the new executive director of regenerative rising and they’re doing such important

work all around the world of women-led organization engaged deeply in this regenerative work,

really looking forward to sharing that episode with you as well. And similarly with Tom Chi,

this is our second interview with Tom and he’s got an update on his view into the near and

midterm economic developments around the global regenerative movement thinking in terms of

three epochs that we’re designing for and deploying both technology and heart-centered practices

in order to achieve together. Really look forward to hearing from Tom. His organization at One

Venture says already deployed somewhere around $150 million in sustainability technologies

and they’re nearly closed on a second fund looking to deploy about twice that $300 million.

We also interviewed two-way Inubake, one of the indigenous chiefs and wisdom keepers from Amazonia

coming at us from the verdant jungles of that part of the world and sharing with us why it’s so

important for us to connect ourselves with the forests, the green living plants and also why it’s

so important for us to engage even more profoundly in our stewardship globally speaking of the Amazon.

It’s such a critical and major ecological preserve of biodiversity that is

providing life to our whole planet and really excited to share two-ways interview with you as well.

And also we’re going to be chatting soon with Matthew Fox who of course has written many books

and including several about Hildegard Funding and I am so enjoying reading this one called

a Saint for Our Times unleashing her power in the 21st century. Of course the term

veritoss which is the name of my novel is a term that was coined by Hildegard Funding and

and it means something along the lines of the green healing energy of the divine that flows

through plants all across the biosphere. And I love reflecting on the abundance that comes to us

from the solar radiance our sun is continuously streaming onto our planet earth something like

173,000 terawatts of energy. And our biosphere through photosynthesis essentially is harvesting

a little over one percent of that inbound energy animating all of the life on this planet.

Of course there are some exceptions, some different critters at the deep sea vents and elsewhere

sub aqueous subterranean environs that don’t receive sunlight and art connected directly to the

photosynthetic cycling of nutrients and energy but by and large virtually all of us living on

earth are alive thanks to the plants and their magical ability to transform sunlight into food.

And as a celebration of our 133rd episode I want to share the code with you gratis,

g-r-a-t-i-s. You can use the code to get any of our e-books for free including

Y honors, the nonfiction foundational tone explaining the myriad strategies and opportunities we

have in our own lives to enhance our health and wellness, our prosperity, our thriving for ourselves,

our homes, our families and our neighborhoods and communities while also exploring in a very

comprehensive manner the interconnected strategies we have for global stewardship regeneration

and sustainability. And so Viriditas, YonEarth are children’s books, our soil stewardship

handbook, all of these are available to you for free if you’d like to download the e-book

versions using that code gratis, g-r-a-t-i-s. And of course YonEarth is also available as an

audiobook and you can use the same code to get that if you’d like. Soon we’ll have Veritas as an

audiobook as well and our dear friend my dear friend Brigitte Mars who’s on our global advisory

board is just about finished reading the audiobook for us and I think it’s so fitting that she’s

the one reading it in part because the protagonist is a super smart woman named Brigitte, Brigitte

Sophia and such a joy to have Brigitte Mars reading it for us and I want to give her a shout out

as well as our entire board and the Brigitte’s on our global advisory board as are many other

wonderful leaders including Bernard Amade the founder of Engineers Without Borders and John Perkins,

the author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman as well as touching the Jaguar and many many

others and a very special things of course to our executive board that’s Ardom Nicholkov,

Katie Ross Garcis and Brad Lidge. A huge shout out to all you guys for all you do for the

Y-unters community and the work that we’re doing. So when we talk about the regeneration renaissance

you know we can deepen into our understanding not only our understanding but also our action

taking. We like to describe the Y-unters community as an action oriented educational

non-profit organization. So when we’re working on the ecology pillar of the regeneration renaissance

the focus on water and soil and restoration and stewardship and of course the detoxification of

our environs is paramount, essential. And when we’re focused on our economy we have the opportunity

to deepen in our understanding of how equity and fairness stewardship versus exploitation for

example. The institutionalization of care and kindness is right at our fingertips with the

strategies and structures and techniques that we and so many of our colleagues around the world

engaged in developing and deploying and scaling up and we’ll be talking more and more in the near

term about the quintenary and how that function within our understanding of the economic value

chains at work in our world will help us reorient and pivot our economic and financial activities

toward a much kinder gentler life supporting and human supporting way of doing business together.

On that note I am so excited to share that we’ve got another book in the works and this book

is actually focused on very concrete very practical strategies for regenerative finance,

social enterprise, stewardship philanthropy and eco scene economics and for this project

in addition to the recommendations and case studies that I’m putting together with the team

we also have a number of essays from contributing guest authors and these are thought leaders

and organizational leaders who have so much wisdom and insight to share with us as we’re engaged

in this great pivot together so really excited to share that with you right now the working title is

the biggest deal it’s a bit of a tongue in cheek title that we explain in the introduction

and assuming it publishes under that title you can keep an eye out for that in the in the coming

months you know we’ve so far this year already hosted something like 15 events and participated

in a handful of others right at the beginning of January on the what’s called the feast of the

epiphany in certain traditions is a time in the biodynamic tradition when we do a three kings

preparation biodynamic preparation stir ceremony for the land and we did this out at Elk Run Farm

and this is when we stir in the frankincense and mure and trace gold to reaffirm our commitment

of stewardship to the land where we’re situated you can do this on your own whether you’re in an

apartment or perhaps a suburban neighborhood setting or even a rural or agricultural setting this

is something you can weave into your practice as well it’s a beautiful way to reaffirm our commitment

to the land for the upcoming annual cycle and this is on January 6 which is essentially a fortnight

two weeks after the winter solstice the time when the sun is in that great returning cycle that’s

so important literally and symbolically to so many of our traditions worldwide we now are hosting

a monthly online meetup this is our regeneration renaissance roundtable the first Sunday of each month

and we kick these off at 11.33 a.m. Colorado time that’s mountain time and the next one coming up

is June 4th if you want to join us please do your most welcome you can go to yonearth.org slash

live to pre-register and that’s an evergreen link that resets each month to the new zoom

registration link for you so you need to register each month and can do so immediately for the

for the next online meetup on June 4th Sunday we also for our ambassadors have the recordings of

these meetups available in our ambassador resources section of the yonearth.org website we also

have many recordings from different talks and workshops that we’ve given over the last several

years available there also so a number of amazing resources for you if you’d like to join our

ambassador network and you haven’t yet you can just go to the uh become an ambassador page on

the website and get the process started there we were recently invited by the Wilson and

Suncini law firm to give a presentation articulating over 50 specific simple daily things we can

do at our homes and our places of work in order to have a better careful stewardship regenerative

oriented impact on the planet and uh that video is one that’s also available we’re making that one

available on the blog page for the general public it’s such an important resource so you can go there

and check that out and on the blog page you’ll also see there’s a recording from our four-part

regeneration renaissance series that we gave in March and this was the concluding evening regeneration

of economics and that evening I gave a talk and we had Charles Eisenstein join as a guest and he

gave a talk and the recording of those talks is also available on the blog page available for

everybody so you can check that out and we’re gonna have one more up for you there let me see if I

can get to it in my list here yeah this is the talk Tom she gave to his annual general

convention for his fund a talk he gave about the three coming epochs of economic development

around regeneration stewardship and so Tom gave us permission to share that with our network

and it’s such an important articulation of where we’re headed and what’s possible so we wanted to

be sure to share that with you as well one more video to mention and this is our soon to be launched

simple gardening wisdom video course we’ve produced this in partnership with drylands agro ecology

research out at elk run farm and earth coast productions we’ve been working on the filming the

scripting and the post production for many months now something like six or seven months and uh

this is such an important resource providing very simple easy to follow tips and tricks recommendations

for you to use in your own garden your own yard your own farm perhaps to enhance your ability to

produce wonderful food and herbal medicine and build soil uh and steward the land for all the

critters including the pollinators while you’re enjoying your your gardening practice so uh if uh

you’d like we’re actually offering that at a steep discount $33 instead of the regularly

price $99 for that video course you can get it right now if you’d want and uh it’s on our store page

on why on earth dot org and uh you know this isn’t meant so much to be an info commercial as

an opportunity to pause and reflect and share that we’ve uh put together so many resources

for you guys and of course have many more coming but just just to take notice of all that we’ve

been able to accomplish and put together for you thus far and really encourage you to take advantage

of what we’ve made available of course all of the podcast episodes are available for free

streaming through the major uh platforms and distribution channels like Spotify, Apple,

video and audio and you can go to our youtube page for that as well and I encourage you to like

and subscribe if you like the information because that definitely helps us reach more people the more

that we get the likes and the subscriptions obviously as most of us are aware so I’d like to pause and

just uh take a moment to reflect have a little tea here warm up it’s a bit chilly out with this beautiful

rain and I’m so grateful to be out here in the woods out of the office away from the buildings

able to really deepen into my connection and appreciation with the living natural world and I

so encourage you to deepen in that practice I think perhaps more than anything else

along with the love and kindness is for us to respond to this invitation to deepen our intimate

relationship with mother nature momagaya the trees the grasses the shrubs the flowers and

perhaps connecting and befriending a particular tree is something that you can do to deepen your

practice connecting with a particular body of water it could be a pond or a lake or a stream

or a river or even the ocean herself these intimate relationships are not only with

afford us a an insight into the supreme intelligence of nature but also provide our own bodies and

minds and spirits a form of nourishment that is very hard to come by in our cities to be honest

and it’s a form of nourishment that has a profound impact on our quality of life one of the best

things we can do to experience a richer fuller more joyful quality of life is is frequently

connect with nature unplug and drop in and if you like you can even take a hike or a walk and

perhaps sit and stay still in a particular spot for a while and observe what’s going on with the

insects the critters the plants the soil the birds the air maybe you’ll be blessed by butterflies

and perhaps even some honey bees and other pollinators i have become increasingly convinced through

my own experience that this frequent direct connection with nature is is imperative it’s essential

and in Verenitas one of the things that gets discussed in that exciting eco thriller story

is the importance especially in these times of connecting with AI with the authentic intelligence

of momagaya of nature and I’m convinced that not only is our connection with nature important

for our well-being and our heart-centered ability to be good stewards to care for the living world

it is also how we can access a particularly elegant and sophisticated and complex

form of intelligence that is otherwise perhaps too elusive for us as humans to directly access

in all of our constructed cities and environments and economics and goings on in our rich human lives

so it’s a deep invitation and of course one of my favorite terms oikos this great term that

is the origin that I’m etymological root for our words ecology and economy point points in

this direction of this relationship with the living world and and oikos means home it’s our home

planet or our home and implicit in this term oikos meaning home is also the concept of community

in ancient Greece we would have referred to our dwelling as our oikos and we would have also

referred to the front room where we would receive guests and neighbors as the oikos of the home

the oikos of the oikos and so in this term is implicit a notion of community and connection and

relationship and as we’re going forward in the healing of our ecological relationships and our

economic relationships and behaviors an awareness of this term oikos is going to help light our path

for us of course the term humus meaning soil is another of my faves and it is connected at

them logically to the words humor and humility and human even so as we deepen into our understanding

of our traditions we come to understand that our human connection with soil is is absolutely

fundamental it’s in many of our creation stories and when we’re interacting physically with the

living microbiome of the soil that has an effect on our own neuro biochemistry and we know that

we experience enhanced immune system function we experience elevated moods through enhanced

serotonin production and even enhanced cognitive performance when we’re on the regular

in physical contact with the living soil it can be through our bare hands gardening planting

flowers and herbs and vegetables it can also be through our feet walking barefoot around the

soils around the land and all of that has this profound nourishment for us to access regularly

another of my favorites is the term wailay or well this middle english term

means well-being and and it’s the same route that we get the word wealth from so as we’re

exploring in our economic work this regenerative renaissance is very much about reclaiming and

redefining what we mean by wealth deep true sustained wealth I would humbly

posit for you is one rooted in relationship in community in our own well-being practices and our

stewardship and regenerative work in our locations and worldwide so there’s wailay

such a joy to share all of this with you and you know what one of the things and I think I’ll

share here in a few minutes why 133 is such a special number for me and so many of my friends and

colleagues our friends and colleagues but it’s such a beautiful opportunity to be connected with so

many thought leaders and farmers and gardeners and herbalists and indigenous wisdom keepers and

others working on this regenerative movement and I’m struck having now interviewed so many experts

one thing’s crystal clear and that is none of us has all the answers many of us have a lot of

important knowledge and wisdom to share no doubt about it many of us have deep expertise to share

and and we have the opportunity to learn so much from one another doing this work but it is struck

me that not one of us at least nobody I’ve met yet has all of the answers and if you know

somebody who has all of the answers please put me in touch I’d love to interview her or him

but my sense is that the the intelligence that we need the ethos the ethic that we need to

cultivate and scale and deploy in this regenerative movement is distributed dispersed like a

neuronal network like the mycelial networks of the forest soils connecting the trees and the plants

so that it’s not residing all in one node in one point it is dispersed and distributed throughout

the community and that is part of the intelligent design of nature that is part of the resilience

built into the incredible fabric of the living biosphere and it’s part of how we get to understand

and appreciate and learn from this incredible richness of insight and wisdom and knowledge

among and between so many of our colleagues and friends and collaborators

the other thing that’s clear to me is that we’re all in this together

that we’re in a process of transitioning being invited to evolve beyond a way of living on the

planet that has winners and losers into a into a way of being that has us understanding deeply that

for any of us to win it requires all of us to win or at least that we’re working from a place

of enabling and supporting all of us winning we’re all in this together and as we

raise each other up as we lift each other up we’re all uplifted so I invite you to

deepen into the practice of uplifting each other whether it’s in line at say the grocery store or

somewhere else perhaps even in rush hour traffic if that’s part of your experience or just

in an encounter with a random stranger or a close friend or an acquaintance from the community

think about the ways we have the moments we have the opportunity to uplift each other and in so doing

uplift ourselves uplift all of us and it’s my deep belief that we’re living in a time where

we get to scale that in a tremendous manner together so Psalm 133

uh this is part of the reason the number 133 is so important to me and so many of our friends and

colleagues it comes to us through the Judeo Christian and even Islamic traditions you may not

be aware of this but the Judeo Christian Islamic traditions the Abrahamic traditions all look to

the Psalms the revelation of David the revelation to David as having very sacred

scripture for us to engage with if we so choose and of course we’re connected to many different

traditions indigenous traditions traditions of the east and Hinduism and Buddhism and Taoism and

Zen and others and in the Judeo Christian Islamic tradition in particular the Psalms have such

beautiful poetry for us to connect with and Psalm 133 in particular is about celebrating community

it goes something like this by the way I should mention there’s a reference to somebody called

Aaron in this Psalm and that’s Aaron from the biblical stories Aaron Moses’ brother Aaron

not me it’s Aaron from the time who had apparently a very long beard and I think it’ll be clear when

you hear the Psalm why his having a long beard might be important and you’ll you’ll hear about the

referencing to an oil like an anointing oil and oil of joy that is so super abundant and it’s a

metaphor it’s it’s a way of describing the incredible joy we get to experience washing over us

as we cultivate community and love and kindness together the song goes like this

behold how good and how pleasant it is when people sisters and brothers dwell together in unity

it is like the precious weightmen upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron’s beard that

went down all the way to the skirts of his garments as the dew of hermen and as the dew that descended

upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more

I love that Psalm and the oil of joy the abundance that it invokes and evokes for us

in our cultivation of our human connections and our connections with the natural living world is

such a beautiful poetic gift I hope you enjoyed hearing that and I was struck doing a little

research just to make sure that I understood the Islamic view on the Psalms I learned that in

the Islamic tradition the Quran of course is considered to have been revealed to Muhammad the great

prophet and there are three other revelations that came before that that are considered sacred as

well to Muslims one is the revelation of the Torah to Moses of course and Moses with his brother

Aaron shared that out with the people that way the Psalms revealed the David as I mentioned in

the Gospels to Joshua the the great teacher Jesus Christ and it’s beautiful to have now a better

awareness of how the Islamic faith views those four great revelations for our world

and yeah just such a wonderful time to reflect on the seasonal cycles here just passing the time

of Beltane the cross-quarter of spring which is halfway between the spring equinox and the

summer solstice and of course we earlier before the spring equinox celebrated in bulk that time

of the belly when so much is happening in the soil and the use our pregnant with the lambs soon

to be born as are many of the other ruminant mammals and grass eating mammals and it’s such a joy

to tune into these seasonal cycles that we’re participating in whether we’re aware of it or not

I think it’s it’s probably one of the ways we can deepen in our connection with the living world

as well as by cultivating our greater awareness of the seasonal cycles go lunar cycles etc and of

course the biodynamic farming gardening and land stewardship tradition invites us to be very

aware of these cycles take a quick sip here of my Purium superfoods which I enjoy every day and

I’m so happy we have this partnership with Purium organic superfoods it’s a conscious network

marketing business model one of the many different business models we see out there contributing

to the regeneration and stewardship of the world while also uplifting people if you’re interested

in getting some of the Purium products you can go right to winer.org and click through on the Purium

$50 I enjoy their superfoods every day it’s become a part of my daily practice for health and

wellness and whether outback packing hiking traveling the powder superfoods are so easy to carry

around and rehydrate with beautiful water wherever we might be so a nice shout out to Purium

and want to give also a shout out to our friends at earth hero they’re offering hundreds and thousands

of wonderful products for our homes our offices and our lifestyles sustainable products like for

example the traveling bamboo utensils that we can take with us keep in our car take with us

when we’re traveling so that we don’t have to use the single use throw away plastic utensils that

are still you know rather pervasive and they’ve got all kinds of other wonderful products cleaning

products products for play and recreation products for the pets the animals so be sure to check

out earth hero and again you can get to them through the partners and supporters page on

whiners.org and I want to be sure to make a big shout out to all of our ambassadors who are engaged

in our projects engaged in this work worldwide and if you’re not yet an ambassador and you’d like

to become one just go to the become an ambassador page on the website and get the process going

we invite our ambassadors to donate on a monthly basis any amount that you’re able and even if

you’re not an ambassador and you’d like to donate you can go to the donate page on the

wire earth site and set that up any level that works for you is super helpful to all that we’re

doing supporting the podcast series and all of the other work that we’re doing and resources

that we’re offering of course for those who choose to give at the $33 or above level each month

are going to receive a shipment of the whale water soaking salts that thank you we’ve got

eucalyptus we’ve got orange cream which is kind of like a cream sickle orange and vanilla throw

back to childhood and these are for soaking in the tub these are made with biodynamically and

regeneratively grown hemp infused and aromatherapy into essential oils salts it’s magnesium sulfate

epsem salt that can be used actually to fertilize your plants and gardens and when you’re done soaking

we’ve got rosemary and pine the moontime blend right here is particularly formulated for women

in their men’s cycle of geranium and meroli have some nice relieving attributes the aromas of

all of them are wonderful I use all of them myself and there are others I brought those for to share

but the whale waters is a little social enterprise we stood up a while back I make these by hand

for you and I make these in a ceremonial manner infused with a sense of love and joy and healing

to bring you relief maybe you’ve got a aching back or aching joints or perhaps have trouble sleeping

or just need to de-stress decompress soaking with a whale bath is such a wonderful way to get all

of those benefits and I do a slow low heat infusion of the hemp flower in organic and regeneratively

grown coconut oil so we get all of the full spectrum phytonutrient benefits from that miraculous

plant and if you’re interested in that miraculous plant we did a special podcast episode with

Brigitte Mars the second one we did with her you can check that out it’s a really fun exploration

of the meaning of the hemp plant and its potential role throughout history so these whale jars

each one is enough for two baths you get two soaks out of that so it’s a great way to bring

your health and well-being practice home with you we of course many of us are familiar with the

farm to table movement wonderful way to connect with local and organic nutrient dense fresh foods

well we like to call whale waters farm to tub so this is a great way to take care of yourself

relax while also supporting some of the farms we work with here in Colorado and supporting the

Y on earth community and then I want to mention two soil works this is another that I make lovingly

by hand for you this jar has a super potent blend of biodynamic preparations and other special

constituent ingredients oh that smell of the soil is so delicious and I love it not for eating

or drinking but this is for your garden your farm your house plants your yard and yeah soil works

you can get on the website as well another great way to contribute to the soil building in your

landscape and the vitality and nutrient density of your vegetables your herbs your fruit trees

etc just taking a glance around it lastly want to be sure to give a shout out to our friends

at doctor Bronners and their new chocolate is so good I’m going to actually enjoy some right now

in this beautiful rain and tell you that we have done several podcast episodes with Dr. Bronners

four of them so far I think with different folks from the Dr. Bronners organization the leadership

gara layzone wrote a book called Trust I Label all about the Dr. Bronners story of course many

be no Dr. Bronners for the soaps organic regenerative biodegradable soap well now they’re making

amazing chocolates and we did an episode with Mike Bronner the president of Dr. Bronners the

grandson of founder a manual Bronner and in that episode we talked all about the way they went

about putting together an amazing line of chocolates for us working with regenerative farms and

communities all around the world growing the ingredients another great way for us to

enjoy health and wellness while supporting supply chains and businesses that are doing such profound

stewardship regeneration and sustainability work all around the world yeah check out that

episode with Mike Bronner if you’re interested and by the way as I’ve mentioned in many of the

last recent episodes after we interview our guests we also now do a short behind the scene segment

that we share with our ambassadors that’s in our ambassador resources page again you need the

password to access those resources and when you become an ambassador I’ll share that with you

but yeah that episode of Mike was so great and encourage you to become an ambassador and check out

those additional resources that we’ve made available for you I’m thankfully getting toward the end

of my list here to share with you I just have a few other projects I want to mention that we’re

currently working on in case you’d like to get involved we’re inviting a few special volunteers

to help out with these projects if it’s of interest just reach out let us know and we’ll be in touch

and just want to take a moment also to articulate that a big part of our work at the YonEarth

community is is about connection it’s about approaching our organizational structure and strategy

like a neuronal network like a mycelial network in the ecosystem helping connect more and more

people and communities and organizations together so that we can learn from each other and share

resources with each other and support and encourage each other that’s a big set of the themes

that we focus on in our monthly online meetups and in addition to connecting we can collaborate

together obviously in these projects I’m going to share an opportunity for that and as we’re

sharing information with each other of course it’s so important that we’re also sharing

inspiration with each other and where I sit getting to interview so many wonderful leaders and

getting to connect with so many wonderful communities and organizations I am absolutely struck

by this rising tide this emerging growing evolution of folks all around the world engaged in

stewardship kindness and regeneration and so the inspiration that comes through the hopefulness

that comes through as we become more and more aware that there are so many of us doing such

great work and that that is in the process of transforming our global systems government and

economic and otherwise so that we can create a world for ourselves and for future generations

that is profoundly grounded rooted in kindness and love and stewardship and regeneration

together and to that end we’ve got a few wonderful projects that if you’re interested reach out

let me know and we can talk about you potentially helping out one is the book I mentioned on regenerative

finance social enterprise stewardship philanthropy and ecosystem economics if that’s in your

wheelhouse up your alley give me a hauler we’ve got some research and some outreach we need to do for

this project secondly we’re putting together a hub an interactive digital platform hub with an

intrap the mapping tool and listing of holistic healers and herbal medicine resources and practitioners

to help us all better connect to the folks who have learned the modalities to share the

heal mind body and spirit and also the farmers and apothecaries working with herbal medicines and

the practitioners who can help guide us around our herbal medicine practices and journeys so if

that’s of interest to you please reach out we’d love to explore having you help out with both the

research and the outreach for our holistic healers and herbal resources and third we’re also working

on a resource for neighborhoods to move in the direction of stewardship regeneration permaculture

composting not putting poisons into the landscapes instead cultivating pollinator gardens

food gardens herbal medicine gardens and many of our neighborhoods of course are governed by

HOAs homeowners associations apparently over 50% of owner occupied homes in the United States are

fall under into that category as having homeowners associations and many of those are still kind of

in the old way of thinking about what prosperity looks like and it’s more of a superficial you know

it’s the lawn neatly manicured and all green with no dandelions for example and more of these HOAs

are already transitioning toward a deeper health oriented understanding that says hey we need

those dandelions to help the early season pollinators after the frosts and the snows melt and the

last thing we should do is poison them the last thing we should do is poison our yards and neighborhoods

you know we’re wondering why our pets are getting sick why our loved ones are getting sick and

part of it is related to these terrible poisons that we’re spraying and that we’ve got in our food

and in our water and we’ve got a huge cleanup job ahead of us and one of the resources we’re working

on in order to help mobilize and scale this up is a neighborhood and homeowners association handbook

and if that’s of interest reach out let let us know and we’ll see if there’s a good fit for you to

help us with that project we’re also working on a big consortium platform project with a whole

bunch of organizations developing a very robust digital tool that can help all kinds of connectivity

across economy culture and ecology worldwide and if that’s of interest give me a holler that one’s

very exciting and we’re keeping some of the details quiet right now as we’re developing the

consortium of collaborating organizations and individuals and reach out if it’s of interest we

can explore bringing you into the fold with the founding team for that project it’s potentially

one of those major game changers and certainly that’s the spirit with which we’re approaching it

from a standpoint of stewardship of deploying the regenerative financial and economic structural

and strategic opportunities we have with that design and with respect to the technology itself the

way we’re approaching that is really inspiring and exciting to not only enhance our connectivity

worldwide but also to enhance our community connections and our nature connections and actually

funny enough ironically unplugging from our technology more and getting out to nature more and

connecting with people in person more so I think that’s my summary for our 133rd episode thank you

so much for tuning in to the YonEarth community podcast it is such a joy to bring this to you this

resource when we started this Artem Nikolkov and I thought hey we know some great folks we ought to

start filming and getting some conversations recorded to help share their knowledge with others

when we launched it we didn’t really have the thought maybe Artem did I did that we were launching a

podcast series but low and behold as we did the first few episodes it became clear hey you know

we could be doing more of this and we’re connected to so many people that have so much important

knowledge and wisdom and insight to share that’s one of the ways we can be in service and it’s with

that spirit that we’re continuing to produce these episodes for you we really appreciate your

support your financial support for the series and for the rest of the work we’re doing at the

YonEarth community please make a donation at YonEarth.org please sign up for a monthly

donation at whatever level works well for you if you’d like to make a substantial donation and

join our stewardship circle reach out let me know I’d be very happy to connect and talk with

you and share some of our annual reports and other strategic plans and vision documents with you

and with all of this it’s with a spirit of humility and gratitude joy and love and kindness that I

am so happy to take some time to visit with you and I’m just overjoyed that all the

pitter powder of the rain is here with us and the trees and the ground are soaked with this

life giving water this water we’re water we’re all water all of us alive are made of water

the water holds the memory the water holds some of the sacred patterning and geometry that’s so

important speaking of geometry and speaking of numbers like 133O struck that 133 we can get to you by

four sets of 33 plus one so you can think of it as the four directions 33 in each direction and

then an additional one in the middle and of course 33 has such importance and if you want to dive

deeper into the sacred geometry and some of the more esoteric aspects of this work connect with us

around the Vereditas Society and some of the recordings that we’ve done in the last few months

available at the ambassador resources love to share that more with you

invite you to close your eyes and unless you’re driving of course if you’re in a safe spot just close

your eyes and perhaps put your feet on the ground and take a deep breath if you’d like

feel the gratitude the joy to be alive have the opportunity to just do such beautiful work together

thank you for all that you’re doing thank you for supporting our work the wire community

thank you for cultivating choosing to cultivate more love and joy and kindness in your life
