## About Trauma Healing in Ukraine

Likened to the Spanish Civil War, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has leveled violence and destruction throughout Ukraine, while Putin’s regime in Russia systematically suppresses dissent and free media, widely disseminates propaganda, and even assassinates would-be challengers by poisoning them. This summer, Dr. Gordon and his team are training 150 leaders in eight regions of Ukraine so that they can provide ongoing trauma-healing services and experiences to Ukrainians traumatized by combat, missile and artillery strikes, and the ongoing threats of escalation and even more horrific weapons deployment.

## About The Center For Mind-Body Medicine

Founded by Dr. James Gordon, MD, The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) provides a public health approach to transforming trauma. According to CMBM’s website, “From war to domestic violence, from public health crises to climate-related disasters, from chronic illness to the vulnerability of aging, from generational trauma to systemic racism – trauma is unavoidable. According to a 2017 report, 70% of adults surveyed across 24 countries reported having experienced a traumatic event in their lifetime. […] Trauma can increase mental distress, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and other chronic conditions.” Led by CEO Dr. Gordon, and Executive Director Rosemary Lombard, CMBC works to relieve trauma and build resilience through evidence-based practices in communities world-wide.
