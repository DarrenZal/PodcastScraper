Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron William Perry.

And today we have the opportunity to visit with an extraordinary scholar and cultural

expert,Soraya Afzali.Soraya, it is so good to visit with you. Thank you.

Thanks to you and thank you for giving me the opportunity to be on this podcast.

Yeah, it’s a real pleasure and I know we’re going to dive into some topics very

salient for our current global situation. You come from Afghanistan, you’re

currently working on a PhD based in Dublin, Ireland, and you are studying the role of charismatic

leadership as it relates to despotism, autocracy, the types of leaders emergent that are not

necessarily at all good for society, good for humanity, good for our world.

Yes, I’m a fourth year PhD student here at Trinity College Dublin. And as you mentioned,

my research focus is charisma and overall charismatic authority and as part of that charismatic

leadership. One of the main focus area, my focus area is to understand how charismatic authority

actually works, how it manifests itself in which kind of setting and as a recipient of this

authority. Ultimately, what should we be aware of? Okay, wonderful. I’m really excited to

dive into this with you. Obviously, so important for all of us.Soraya Afzalireceived her bachelor’s

degree in business management at the American University of Afghanistan at her masters in international

relations from Central European University.Sorayahas several years of experience and communication

and has contributed to different research projects with international organizations as a consultant.

She has contributed to the World Bank Group’s education management information system in collaboration

Sorayais passionate about promoting diversity and inclusion. For her master’s thesis,

she focused on mechanisms of inclusion in educational systems. Within her volunteer work,

she has volunteered for solace for the children, the American councils, and co-founded Humans of

Kabul in 2013 to tell stories of Afghan people. Throughout the years,Sorayahas been part of different

networks that focus on civil society empowerment, such as Open Society Foundation initiatives

of change in the co-scholars program and the Lucille Foundation, which of course,

Sorayais how we met. She is the recipient of the United States and Best

Embassy Scholarship and Open Society Leadership Award. AndSoraya, you and I, we’ve had an

opportunity over the last few months to have a few really deep and lovely conversations about the

work that you’re doing, work that is taking on some very challenging and difficult topics.

And I’m so thrilled we have the opportunity to share your wisdom, your knowledge, and your insights

with our audience because it’s something you’re focused on, something that is so vitally important

to the fabric of the societies and the global society in which we’re all participants and we’re

all connected. And so, I guess, you know, to kick things off, let me just ask you,

why charisma, why a focus on charisma in your work and your research and how how did you come

to a focus on charisma and charismatic leadership? Thank you, Aaron, and thank you for such a

kind introduction. The answer to this question, I can do it in two parts or from two perspective.

One is personal and the other is rather theoretical and academic. And I will tackle the academic

one first. Charismatic authority is interesting because it can be both rational and it can be

irrational. It doesn’t have any framework to work with compared to other kinds of authority that

has been theorized by sociologists to name one of the prominent one, Max Weber, which are, for

example, bureaucratic authority or legal authority that deals with laws and policies and paperwork

and so on. But the charismatic authority does not rely on any of these. It’s almost like a fluid

type of authority that can exist within the bureaucracy, within the legal sphere, or it can

exist quite purely. And this is why it becomes interesting because there is no standards of

framework that it can be implemented by and if somebody who is prone to be convinced to charismatic

authority will be no matter if the idea is probable or pragmatic or logical or not.

So this is why I find charismatic authority interesting and specifically its role in

propagation of hate. I think there is a strong element in here that needs to be developed

further. And the other part of my answer to your question is of course personal and it comes

back to me doing what I do and why I do it. In my research I focus on hate against immigrant

communities and this can be interpreted in many ways, taken from racism, to bureaucracy,

to different structural systems of the hate that is present against immigrant communities.

And with immigrant communities I mean immigrants in Europe, immigrants in part of the region

where I come from and currently worldwide. I was born as an immigrant and therefore these

experiences of hate in the form of exclusion was rather normalized state of being for me as a

child as a grown up person and even now here in Ireland. So what makes this work? What makes

us still rely on these forms of hate and exclusion and still carry on and how do we not question that.

And I think there’s a matter of influence that happens in here. So this is why I ended up

researching this authority because it also has this personal dimension of rather exploration

from my side. So briefly that would be my answer for this.

There’s so much to dive in here in the academic theoretical side of things.

But before going there I want to ask because I’ve been really fascinated by Afghanistan in particular

and I think in part because I’m here in Colorado and some of the landscapes is actually very

similar although obviously much of the culture is probably quite different in some respects.

I want to ask you what’s it like that relationship with Afghanistan which has a rugged mountainous

landscape compared to a place like Ireland where you are that is softer and greener and often

raiding you know it’s very different climates and geographies. I was just wondering if you

could share a little with us just from your personal perspective and experience the ways maybe

that you relate to those two different places. Yes there is a couple of things that comes to my mind.

I absolutely agree that Colorado is in fact like Afghanistan the landscape. There’s elements

of weather that is quite similar and I think I strongly felt that when I was in Colorado and from

your question you know what comes to me is the perception of home. What does that actually mean

you know you know moving between spaces from landscape to internal feelings, from immigration

to displacement to all these different experiences. One of the things that I have realized is that

home is a space within it is quite internal and to have a kind of obsession over wanting to be

home or wanting to have a particular setup that signifies home. I believe it’s not a quite

healthy perspective to go about it and I want to take myself as an example.

If I am in Ireland and I still think about Afghanistan which I do in so many ways but I have

decided that this place of home is something that I keep within myself. It could be a smell. It

could be the smell of the bread. It could be like the breeze of the spring, the smell of the flower

and those things are the sentiment of life are mostly what I resonate with as home and this notion

has made me quite flexible and at ease to move between spaces and this is how I am in Ireland as well

as an Afghan as somebody who has lost home and country over and over being 1990s

kids. It’s the second time that I have lost my home and my country and from 1996 where the

Taliban took over Afghanistan all the way to three years ago 2021 the generation that worked on

different areas, different improvements within Afghanistan and country was and is my generation.

So things that we have lost now is a loss for people like me whose teenagehood, whose

bachelor’s degree time, master’s degree time, higher education time was spent really working

on institutional building and building that a strong network of young generation leadership

and leaders and to lose that is not something that is easy to live with.

So being here in Ireland I’m grateful for many things while carrying this sense of home within

myself but also knowing that whatever I do, even my work, even my conversation with you today

remains as a form of resistance to for a better world, for a better living that is you know

not separate and remains interconnected. It’s really really beautiful and for me lands as wisdom,

the ways speak about home being within and it reminds me of hearing from I think many luminaries

a sense that the entire world is our home and we all share it and to combine that with this

experience of home within I think is very powerful and as maybe a segue into the deep academic

research and theoretical work you’re doing around this topic of charismatic leadership and

the way it can mobilize hatred, racism, xenophobia and exclusion. I’m struck that often times

that kind of charismatic leadership links with a sense of geographic territory right whether it

was Hitler talking about the the gluten burden, the blood and soil of the German identity or

in many countries right now today this major concern around border security right is taking

on all kinds of dimensions and affecting different people in all kinds of ways. I’m wondering

in your work looking at how charismatic leadership can ultimately lead to terrible

violence and tragedy do you do you see a very strong link to a sense of geographic

territoriality or is that more of an occasional or coincidental link?

Yes I think all of these factors are quite contributing to how charismatic authority works

and it’s more almost like tactic that is being used and this tactic you know like doesn’t

have to be somebody like Hitler for us to realize that okay you know he was charismatic and

he was able to convince such a strong number of crowds to follow him and this tactics can happen

from a low skill to a large skill it can happen between two people to you know thousands and you

know within crowds and and and and so forth. The one determining factor that mixed charisma works

is that an interaction needs to happen there needs to be two people interacting in the leadership world

it is known as the follower and the leader because for example somebody can be charismatic

and if they do not interact with other people the charisma might never be discovered so so this

is why this element of interaction can be you know is the very first and foremost important thing

in in in manifestation of charismatic authority. Now returning back to your question and with

geography and and race and and these elements are contributing to this authority manifestation

absolutely yes but they function as a way to rationalize a certain arguments to rationalize

the argument of the person who uses their charisma. This is why you know whether the initial point

is logical or not does not matter or rational or irrational does not matter but they use these

geographical arguments to back their arguments up. For example you know we take the Taliban you know

the Taliban their their fight is based on a charismatic authority because it’s a it’s a matter of

influence for for people to be part of their group to be part of their movement and this is

backed by religion it’s backed by politics which has its own a regional political situation

and and so forth we can dive deeper into this if if we wanted but to give an European example let’s

say let’s say for instance urban you know he’s one of the most far-right and considerably

charismaticly counted charismatic in in central Europe and he is known to be one of the people

who who is far-right who is pro-Christian and anti-immigrant and there has been many

analysis of his speeches as well in relation to different tactics he uses so one of the one of the

ways he goes on about it is to use the religion of Christianity as a starting point that yes we are

Europe your Christian and you are threatened by the emigrants and and to put forward this very

general statement your in the middle and open to interpretation is the core of this problem first

of all for what is European European consists of many many diverse amounts of diverse background

of people coming together Christianity itself has diversity but to generalize these terms

and and instrumentalize it within politics this in itself is a tactic of charisma you curate a

sense of enemy you say this is your enemy and this is what you should do and you know within the

framework of emotions of charisma this is a process that is known as evoking you know evoking

a sense of emotion and and what better than religion to to evoke a sense of emotion something that

is very personal but also very public and and can be practicing in in both ways and and and this

evoking you know is is one of the one ways of going on about it and after a sense of enemy is

is constructed then the second stage would be in accordance to the emotions of charisma is

revoking you know a stage and revoking is when the change of hearts happen when people realize

for example if I am in Hungary and I see this surge of immigrants coming into the country

and as a person I’m like oh okay he’s actually right there are people showing up in the country

that look different from us have different religion have different culture so it must be these

people that this politician is talking about so this is where the change of hearts happen this is

where the central point of argument happens where people no longer see themselves as any end of

victim or a non-partisan people but decide to do something about it they they they gain a sense

of agency a sense of urgency is is also created and and this is what I like you know about analyzing

emotions of charisma and by the way this framework is by Patricia L from the 1980s based on an

article she has written and and she also describes these very clearly by analyzing different

speeches and she she says the last stage is reframing and when reframing happens and particular

leaders that use these tactics and and have their have this element of charisma reframe the

situation for people and and reframing is a plan to action you know like so if you believe me

what I say and if you strongly resonate with it here is a plan of action for me here is how you

can vote here is how you can have more Hungarian children here is how you can you know contribute

for this certain agenda that this particular politician or one for example has so I want to

circle back because we talked about you know tactics emotions sense of enemy political agenda all

of these but again you know what is charisma you know is it a quality is it something that people

can learn is it you know how does it work you know okay these tactics work and they’re in place

so to answer the answer to that is that it is both you know it is a quality that a person has

based on you know different relationships how they evolved in life and and it’s also a rhetoric

meaning that it can be learned it can be practiced to perfection it’s for urban it’s all about you

know having this you know wearing this suit that looks like somebody who who is a businessman who

gets things done who is you know goes to job and and at the same time appearing as a person who

goes and talks to the local people you know with the butcher with the shopkeeper with the

with the with the supermarket people with you know like slaughtering a pig with the local people

and and he does all of these activities and they’re curated very carefully they are

distributed among people through different channels of social media particularly for for a certain

purpose that that this is this is the guy to vote for this is the guy that can lead us further

and this is exactly how charisma works to to to create that that sense of first trips and

and being treated and and then rescuing somebody from that state state of being and and and you

know this is how it functions how and and you can see that okay it is it can be related it can

instrumentalize religion in this particular case that we talked about it’s it can instrumentalize

many other you know a way of being it can instrumentalize economy the region politics of region

the instrumentalizes wars like you know one can go ahead and analyze organs relationship with

Russia and Ukraine and you know all these different dimensions they all become a contributing factor

you know for these manifestation of like tactics and and so forth yeah so it’s so interesting so

and then Victor Orban I understand for currently his prime minister of Hungary is that his position

yeah you know okay I want to I want to back up one minute here because when when you and I began

speaking together several months ago and and we initially were talking about charismatic leadership

what came to mind for me were figures like Gandhi or Martin Luther King or even some of the

greatest luminaries that have led to entire global religious movements like Jesus or Muhammad or

Gautama Siddhartha the Buddha or Confucius and I think of in in in other like historical context

charismatic leaders like Winston Churchill or Ben Franklin how do you in in what’s ironic to

me in all of this is that that so many of the most charismatic who seem to be oriented around

love and kindness and wisdom and humanitarianism often the the religions the institutions the

movements created in the in the wake of those individual impulses then later on get twisted and turned

into very dark and sinister forms of charismatic leadership and immobilizing people so I guess what

I’m trying to ask is how the heck do we do you do we understand the difference between a charismatic

leadership that is working in service to humanity genuinely authentically and a charismatic

leadership that is that is contrary to that and and I ask again I think you know we can point

to some of the most stark maybe black and white examples but I’m wondering even in today’s politics

in many nations of the world we’ve got you know figures were some of my friends and family would

say oh that person I think is mobilizing hatred or xenophobia well another friend or family member

would say no that that’s my person that’s my guy that’s that did not charismatic leader speech

on my behalf right and so how the heck do we tease all of this apart yeah yes charismatic

authority can be used for both good and bad equally it can go to any direction to notice or to

realize it’s it’s potential for for propagation of hate is the nature of manipulation

it is we we always have to and and and I talk in the political and religious context because I

study in instrumentalization of religion in politics so when when one mixes pull pull politics and

and religion there is always an agenda behind this there is this whole setting is a field open

to manipulation and I think this is the first you know the ecotomy that we have to notice that

what is happening you know between this intersection the second thing that we can notice is the

element of history you know how our history has been used and and for what purposes is it used

to unify or is it used to bring more separation that brings hatred and and you know this this can

happen you know on on on different levels of course you know for example you know stories

behind religion even you know if if one you know is scrutinized Christianity or Islam both of them

there is many segments between among the two religion and many contradictions and sects

and different disciplines that disagree with each other but we need to pay attention that which

one of these are are proposed to me to evoke or to threaten threaten me to create a sense to create

a sense of enemy this is the first stage that’s you know we need to pay attention for example you

know this whole issue of you know immigrants and Christianity and Muslim immigrants and so

forth which is one example and then the the alternative what what has been you know offered to

us we need to also pay attention to that what kind of framing what kind of agenda is being put

forward and and who benefits from it and and and what goes on and I know that these things are not

you know quite you know easy and and for you know for our daily life to to always pay attention to

but to to question these constantly is is and I think we’re arriving at a state that we always

have to question these and if we do not we are simply contributing to to this build up of a

system that we no longer can you know control and I think questioning these and is is the way to go

on about it and and also I think personally the more I study you know religious radicalization

in this process that happens individually and within groups from Taliban to far right in Europe

and I’m sure equivalents also exist in the US the manipulation to religion is is a very

sensitive state of being because it deals with sacred values of people that are very individual

and are very personal and and when you threaten people’s sacred values whatever that is whether

whether it is religious or not you take away something from them you take away a sense of belonging

from them and and and and these sacred values needs to come within a framework of not only respect but

but out of politics completely and and this is the beginning of you know how we can

promote more unity where we have shared goals for a for a better coexistence and co-living and

life and and and and this element of belonging is is very important in here as well in relation to

sacred values because I belong first to myself to my own sacred values within Christianity within

Islam within you know my home whatever that is and and this belonging is how I function in in the

world you know this is how I find people like my own self who who have the same values and how I

become a member of a group you know and how I create a sense of you know being how how I develop

ethics morality all of that happens among group it happens among communities and and it is

this this this sensitive this fragile you know state that has been that is that has been manipulated

you know within our political system and and the the instrument that has pioneered this

manipulation is in fact religion and and and more so like in 2024 of course if we go back to

the history you know religion and politics has always been you know mixed together but this is

we live in a world where the world is becoming smaller and and connected more and more

we’re asking somebody where are you from the no longer makes sense because of the migration and

you have the climate migration coming our way if we do not pay attention to these things so

so so we need to take a moment and notice that okay there is a there is an alternative approach to

this and that is to separate the two the politics and the religion and and and not and make sure

everybody’s second values or respected you know in some ways and equally ideally yeah yeah excuse me

wow there’s so much there’s so much to unpack here I my my mind is going in two different directions

and you know I want to mention one thing that strikes me as very ironic you you just mentioned

climate refugees and I know that many of the world’s intelligence and military and policy

communities have been looking at potential forecasted scenarios over the next few decades and I’ve

heard and seen models that anticipate upwards of 700 million to one billion individual human

beings displaced by climate events and I think one of the great ironies at least thinking about

some of the the the political lines in this country is that I for folks who are really concerned

about something you know something like borders getting overwhelmed by refugees one of the

best things they probably could do is take a very proactive stance on climate change mitigation

ironically and and politically those two don’t necessarily tend to go together right now it seems

so that was just maybe a side thought that I’m having but I’m really I’m wondering I almost I’m

almost thinking that you know we could we could see a little handbook that that could help

each one of us better understand hey am I susceptible to charismatic authoritarianism because of

my sense is that when we are we’re not very aware of the fact that we likely are and I wonder

from as much of an objective standpoint as possible how do we outline or delineate or even even

guide somebody through a process of self examination and critical thinking and perhaps you know a lot

of times when folks have the privilege and opportunity of formal education higher education these

these kinds of skills are are incoocated as a matter of course in the curriculum but for for many

of us those are not the pathways we experience so I’m just I’m thinking out loud and I’m thinking

about an organization like the LCL foundation where you and I metSorayaand there are so many

amazing inspiring heart-centered leaders connected through that amazing network and in my my sense

is that I don’t I don’t get the sense that the leaders in that organization are moving in a

direction of charismatic authoritarianism right and so it’s a two-part question like as leaders how

do we know we’re not going down a pathway toward authoritarianism and as individual global

citizens of the world how do we know our degree of vulnerability or likelihood to fall prey to

that kind of leadership yeah I think I would like to return back to to the element of belonging and

and hopefully I’m not just reaching this this answer to this question too far and but I keep

on jumping between my analysis of Europe and also the Taliban because this is the two segments

that I’m focused on and and I want to mention that you know Taliban being recognized as a very

fundamental you know radical group that propagate hate quite actively is is nothing that is

you know hidden from the world you know and and they their degree of radicalization also happens

through a process of charismatic authority influence and and you know being convinced to do

jihad being convinced to fight for you know religion and and this obviously happens among groups

and individual and individual bases as well but but one might question that’s why a person

is being influenced by by this authority and the answer to that is the sense of belonging

because there is there is somebody the in the network of the Taliban that offers a sense of

belonging to a person that has nowhere to go that doesn’t belong in in Afghanistan that no longer

fits in the society and and has been you know through education of you know radicalization

and and certain in certain ways in certain based on certain curriculum has has ended up there

and then the very first you know process of influence happens by by imagining this this sense of

belonging okay I’ve got this and this is where I belong and and this happens in you know

on any scale you know it’s not very specific to Taliban it’s not specific to the concept of

Afghanistan um so how how do we you know imagine a better you know a better version of this

where there is no radicalization and hate in in between and one of the ways to go on about it

is to look at it as a as a community building that there is no longer no longer a leader no longer

a central figure to be to be followed but it like the community moves as a community in a

collective way and and I’m sure if if this alternative agenda would have been put in place

even for Taliban even in the context of Afghanistan it would have had a different outcome but the

problem is that they have this this imagination or rather interpretation of certain leader that

this is how one should be this is the way to go and and there’s many other political

and um

contributing factor into this which I’m not going to delve into um but to to coming back to Europe

coming back to a more you know non-individual um um sitting how how do we prevent authoritarian how

do we prevent you know um radicalism of any kind and all of that and I think for this people

need a shared goal you know and and I just want to uh mention and and I want to trigger the mind

of whoever is listening to to replace religion with climate change in politics perceptions change

You know, it’s true religion that people have, uh, politicians have constantly constructed

sense of enemies that it has been instrumentalized because our leaders, our political leaders

more so in Europe, like lack, uh, reflection on the collective goal, collective challenge

that we have. You know, if you, if you want, uh, you know, if you want to be, um, counsellor

or in the parliament or, or a politician, you have to convince people and for this you

need a plan and then for that plan to work, you need to come from a certain background,

you have to be wise, you have to be Christian, you have to be, or a person of color or coming

from this country. And the list goes on and, and, and one of the things that is missing

in here and, and, uh, one of the reasons that, you know, our politicians have ended up

in this way is because of the lack of a shared and, and collective goal, you know, um,

and when we have that, I think we, we have, uh, an approach and a proper agenda to follow

that. And, and, and nothing at this moment is better than, you know, taking, um, care

of climate change, um, taking care of like our planet, making our systems more inclusive

and, and better. And, and, and I think this should be our, our goal, um, and, and none

of this happened, uh, singularly. It all happens, um, collectively, it all happens, um,

as, um, people and communities coming together, um, uh, even, even if we have a one leader

that directs all of this, again, there will be a problem because it’s just one person,

um, so it has so much potential to, to end up, um, autocratic, um, and so forth. Um, so,

it’s, it’s more about shifting approach, shifting approach, changing our goals, changing our

agenda, um, and, and, and, and questioning these things and, and asking these difficult questions

continuously, um, that, you know, that, that how, how do we approach life? Because at the end

of the day, we all want to belong, you know, this, this person who is being radicalized,

in any religion, in any setting, at the end of the day, wanted to belong somewhere. Um, and,

as a society, as a society, we have not provided that space of belonging for this particular

person who have been radicalized. And, and we need to question that, that’s why have we ended up

in here? Um, and how can we, how can we turn that around? You know, how can we change that?

Um, so that would be, that would be my answer to your question.

Wow. So much to, to ponder and, uh, to consider. I want to remind our audience, this is the

interview, we will spend some additional time together in our behind-the-scenes segment that

is made available exclusively, uh, to our ambassador network. So a huge thanks to everybody,

making this series possible. AndSoraya, you know, a huge thanks to you, uh, for the, for the work

that you’re doing. You know, I think from a certain perspective, we can look at history as a,

a, a, a beautiful and diverse capestry woven by threads of many people striving for the good and

striving for, uh, working in service to humanity and to the environments that we share together.

And of course, uh, throughout history, there are many, many examples of the, the violence,

the bloodshed, the suffering, the hatred that can get mobilized through, uh, human leadership.

Um, and, and your earlier comment reminds me of the, the scene, uh, where basically George

Washington was presented with the opportunity to be president for life, for the rest of his life.

And he refused. And, and, and maybe many folks look at that moment as a moment when something

very special was made possible in the imperfect, but, uh, directional, uh, striving of the

democratic system represented by the United States of America. And of course, he had that point

in time could have said, yeah, I’d love to be president for life. I, I’m, I’m wondering,

right? And, and, and I’m not necessarily expecting that you can answer this for us.

But what is it in your opinion that causes a leader like that to refuse, uh, the, the,

unbridled, virtually unlimited power? And apparently there’s a, there’s a, the saying that,

the king of England upon hearing this story and, and hearing, asking about George Washington’s

whereabouts and hearing, oh, he had gone back to his farm and was farming, uh, that, the king

responded by saying, well, that’s the most powerful man in the world. Um, what are your thoughts on that?

What, what, what’s going on there in that inner alchemy of, of the leader that can end up in a,

in an authoritarian, violent, uh, situation, or can, you know, put in motion forces for goodness

for humanity? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to look that up, uh, and include it in, in my research. So

thank you for, for sharing that. Um, and, uh, yeah, that, that, that is a good question. And, and,

the only thing that comes to my mind is, um, is greed and, and, and ego and, uh, elements of

narcissism, um, that, that, you know, that unfolds in here. And, um, there is a lot of, you know,

studies psychologically done in the field of, um, in the field about narcissism and, and leadership.

Um, and, and I think this is where it lies, you know, that, um, how, how our leaders, how

a potential leader can navigate that. And, and to, to, how far of an extent, are they willing to,

to go to feed this, um, they’re not, this narcissistic, you know, approach to, to life. Um,

and, and I think, you know, at the, at the end of the day, you know, this is something that, um,

is imposed on us by, by our system, you know, we, we are in, in a lot of ways, part of this whole

setting as well, you know, if we take, um, you know, our, um, our politics and, and our, uh, that

has ended up in the way that it has. And, um, a simple example of that would be capitalism. And,

and how, um, how greed, uh, has been used in, in capitalism. How, you know, the, the idea of

wanting more and more and never being enough, uh, is, is an instrument of capitalism. This is how,

how, how it’s said. Um, and, um, so it, it is obviously like a, a human, you know, um,

human element, you know, that, that exists within us that needs to be, um, unpacked and, and paid

attention to, um, to simply, you know, understand that what we already are in abundance of many

things that, you know, we, um, ask for, whether that is, you know, power or, or material or,

however it unfolds in our life. Um, and, and, and, and understanding that is, is something

um, that is not taught to us as kids, um, as children. And it’s only now, you know, in, in, in this,

you know, era that we are over questioning that, okay, um, you know, um, how capitalism system

works, uh, why have they ended up in this like, um, political system that constantly, no matter

how many laws and policies are, uh, put in front, it still marginalizes, it’s still backfires,

um, and, and it’s designed that way. It is, it is, it is a massive system designed for these

things to function the way they do. Um, and, and one, one point of, you know, stopping this is,

again, you know, asking these, um, difficult questions continuously and, um, and, and going for,

for asking the big question, but also small questions and encouraging those with our younger

generation, um, with our children, um, um, even more so. Um, so this is how, how we can have a

change of, you know, hearts. Um, so, yeah, and I think, um, the president of the United States,

when, um, when he said something like that, obviously has already understood this, uh,

this element of, you know, um, the joy of simple things, you know, of being happy, of, you know,

that agreed is something that can never be fulfilled or, or, or filled in, in some ways.

Absolutely. Yeah. It is reminding me of, uh, something John Rogers said, uh, when we recently had

John on the podcast, uh, he’s the author of the Renaissance campaign, of course, uh, central to

the, uh, work being done at the LCL foundation and he said, power changes people. And, uh,

I’m struck by that. I, I, I think there’s a deep inquiry there and I’m also struck by your

mentioning of children and narcissism. I, I have come to understand in the, in the mental health

arena that there’s more understanding that often when people end up exhibiting narcissistic

behavior that it is tied to and, and perhaps the result of, uh, childhood trauma or other trauma

that hasn’t been addressed and healed and mitigated and so forth. And, and so there’s a very

strong correlation there at least as I understand it. Um, and, and I wonder, you know,

ways in which we as a society, we as community leaders might think about helping to

mitigate that, that directionality, I think so many of us, of course, have experienced so many

types of, of traumas through our lives. And it seems, you know, to me, one of the ways we can help

heal our, our societal structures and systems is, is kind of back to your earliest point about

home within, right? Sort of starting at ground zero as it were starting at the, the, the interior

of our own cells. And I’m, I’m wondering if you’ve thought much about ways we might help to

do that at scale in society. Yeah. Yes. I’m, I’m very glad that the topic of trauma is coming up,

you know, our conversation. Um, and, and it is something that, um, exists, um, on a large scale,

unfortunately in our society. Um, and trauma is directly, directly links, um, to, to again,

a sense of, you know, belonging and identity as well. Um, you know, oftentimes there is a part of us

that, um, been, you know, traumatized from, from whatever it is. And, and oftentimes that, um,

stage is a loss of something. Um, for example, for me, you know, um, a loss of country, you know,

it’s, it’s, it has its own traumatic implication. And, and the Afghan generation in my generation

are also going to, to this, um, collective trauma, you know, that, uh, that we have to face.

Um, and, and it becomes, uh, it contributes to a sense of identity and, uh, and, and when you,

when we reflect, um, on the connection of trauma and identity, the, we come back to again,

to the sense of belonging, you know, and, um, and, and, and this is, this is why, um, belonging

should be encouraged more, belonging of, um, belonging in society, you know, contributing to,

um, including, contributing to inclusionary policies that do not backfire, um, within, you know,

our, our systems that, that we function with. Um, and, um, so this is, this is part, part of,

you know, like, um, you know, what I have to answer to this, um, and, and another thing about trauma

is, um, trauma is also an element that, you know, that I talked about, you know, this fragility of,

you know, being influenced by charismatic authority. A big part of that is trauma, because

an unresolved trauma gives more chances to be influenced by charismatic authority.

For good and for bad, you know, and if it is on the good side, it’s good, but the, the challenge

arises when, when this sense of being offered in a, in, in the bad spectrum of this, um, charismatic

belonging. Um, and again, you know, circling back, um, radicalization has also, um,

has a lot of connection and connotation that has to do with, uh, trauma. Um, the, the trauma of,

you know, um, racism, the trauma of any kind of hate, um, the trauma of being excluded, the

trauma of, um, being threatened to be yourself. You know, all of these, again, you know,

freed back to a state of fragility that is open to, to, to adapt to what is there that is offered

to us. Um, so, so we just, I think we need to create spaces that, um, encourage, um, a positive

sense of belonging, um, and, and this is easier than we think. Um, we pay attention to our collective

goals as, as cities, as communities, um, as, on how can we be better citizens, how can we

function better in our community from our home, to our street, to our, uh, little village,

to our city and then country. And forget about all these borders and, and then cliches and

stigmas that are attached to our old narratives, then I think that’s a very good place to start with.

Um, and there’s a lot of initiatives that already, um, does this, um, uh, here in Ireland, you

know, we just, um, um, working on, uh, garden communities that bring people together that become

spaces of creativity, but also conversation about, um, difficult things among people from one

that has ended up on one street. Um, and I think it is those spaces that, that people can start to,

um, feel the belonging, um, in a, in a community, in a community and diverse way, in a rich way.

Mm, mm, mm. I love it. I love it. I love it. I, I love hearing about the, the garden community

concept because there’s so much going on there with the microorganisms affecting our neuro biochemistry

when we’re interacting physically with the, the soil ecosystem and bringing people together to

have conversations in what is usually a pretty safe, relaxing environment, uh, how beautiful.

Yep. I want to, I want to mention, you know, we’ve had a few other, uh, really extraordinary, uh,

guests on the podcast talking about some of these topics and including, I want to mention Dr.

James Gordon, uh, who’s doing work to heal trauma in the entire, uh, nation and society of Ukraine,

in the midst of war. Um, the conversation we’ve had with him was really extraordinary.

Also with Dr. Anita Sanchez, especially regarding, uh, trauma as it relates to some of the

indigenous cultural experiences, um, and also women’s experiences in particular.

And of course, uh, Dr. Sanchez is on the board of Pachamama Alliance,

as is John Perkins. Uh, I want to mention John Perkins, who, uh, writes extensively about some of

the systems and structures in place in the global, uh, cultural and economic fabric that need, uh,

to transform, need to evolve. Um, I can’t help but mention our forthcoming book,

color, biggest deal that we’re putting together with a number of authors on this topic. And so, um,

stay tuned. We’ve got an essay from John Perkins in there looking at the difference between life

economy and death economy, which, Soraya, I want to ask you about in a moment, because it’s

something you’ve identified in your work. I want to also mention, uh, Dr. Jan Dell Allen Davis,

an extraordinary leader who, um, has been on the podcast twice, talking about her work as a

medical doctor and executive of a hospital. And also she’s on the board of the Federal Reserve.

Uh, and we did our second episode with her after the murder of George Floyd and, uh, Dr.

Jan Dell Allen Davis is African-American woman and has shared such a, uh, raw and, and vulnerable,

uh, part of herself in the days following that incredible, uh, tragedy. Um, so I wanted to mention

that as well. And finally, also the work of Dr. Robert Cloninger, and he’s looking as a, uh,

psychiatrist and a geneticist at some of the fundamental, uh, attributes making up each of us,

individually determining and, or indicating our likelihood to be concerned about all of humanity

or people outside of our sphere, people we don’t know, uh, versus those of us not so concerned,

more kind of tribalistic in our orientation. And I’m really curious. I want to follow up and ask

Dr. Cloninger if they’ve done any correlating or deeper, um, research looking at trauma,

as it might play out in, in the matrix that they’ve, uh, developed in their research. And he’s

one of the most cited scientists on the planet alive right now. Um, so, uh, really, uh, exciting that

we have the opportunity to weave some of these, uh, expertise and perspectives together. And

coming back to this life versus death orientation that, uh, John Perkins writes about in terms of

economy, uh, Sir, I’m, I’m really curious because you and I spoke a few weeks back about this

in the, in the rhetoric, right, of, uh, uh, some charismatic authoritarian leaders. And I was hoping you

could, uh, elucidate this for us. Yeah. Um, absolutely. Um, I think what comes to my mind,

in relation to, to charismatic authority and part of my research is, um, the concept of
