Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m Aaron Perry, your host, and today we’re

visiting with Shelby Kaminski. Hey Shelby. Hi. How’s it going? Wonderful. How are you?

Great. Welcome. Shelby graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2016 with

a degree in Environmental Studies and Geography. She also earned the internationally renowned

Permaculture Design Certificate during her studies. She is continuing her education with online courses

about the soil food web, pesticides certifications with the USDA, and working closely with the community.

Shelby also owns the company Edaphic Solutions and we’re going to be talking a lot today about

what Edaphic does. And the company was started in 2016 with a mission to help people reduce their

chemical fertilizer use, grow soil to grow healthy plants, and store carbon into our soils.

So Shelby, it’s so great to visit with you today. Yay. And as you know, love soil and love

microbes. And I’m really excited that we get to chat a bit about a very practical thing you’re

doing for our community. Tell us, maybe as a way to jump right in, what’s this word Edaphic?

Why are you using this word for your company? Yeah. So it definitely took a while to figure out

good company name, but the word Edaphic comes from edifology, which is the soil science of how

soil interacts with living organisms, so plant, humans, the microbes. And then pudology is the

soil science of the minerals, the soil. So I kind of took that word edifology, turned it into

edaphic, and then solutions because it is compost tea as a liquid solution, and then also compost tea

as a long term soil health solution. So you’re essentially in the greater front-range territory of

the Denver, Colorado region, including Fort Collins, Boulder, and other outline communities.

You’re essentially going around and spraying compost tea on the landscape, is that right?

Yeah, landscapes, farms, gardens, lawns, houseplants, really any plants.

Great, okay. And we’re going to a little later on. We’re going to actually show you guys

some of the equipment that Shelby has. It’s really awesome. And we thought this would be a really

good podcast episode, not only to share with our local community, because I figure a lot of folks

in our Y&R community network are going to be interested in what Shelby’s offering, but also

in other geographic regions, this is a great example of a regenerative business model that can

be replicated in other places. And I know Shelby’s happy to speak with folks if you’re from another

region and interested in having her consult and help you get started. So yeah, so we’ll show you

some of that hands-on stuff a little later on, a little teaser to look forward to that. And I love

you right on your website, which is edaphxolutions.com. You’ve got a definition of compost tea, and I’ll

just read it, because it’s so right on and to the point. It’s a highly concentrated liquid form

of compost that is made by extracting and multiplying beneficial microbes and aerated water.

The finished product is a living tea that functions as a fertilizer, as well as a non-toxic

pesticide, right? And we know a lot of folks in the agricultural world, even working on commercial

landscapes and so on, have to suit up with hazmat suits because of the chemicals they’re dealing

with it. You don’t have to wear that, do you? No, I get it all over my skin and it’s really safe for

dogs. When I’m spraying, sometimes people’s dogs run outside. So calling it as a pesticide is a

little pushing it, but it does what you want a pesticide to do, right? Yeah, and it’s probably a

combination of strengthening the plants, which we know as part of how to deal with pest pressure

anyhow. And then also, so what pesticides do is pretty much just kill all of the pests, and that

also kills all the beneficial microbes. So what compost tea does is I’m spraying beneficial microbes

onto that area, and then those microbes kind of deal with each other, and then the pests are

out competed by the beneficial, so that makes sense. So it’s like a probiotic sort of deal,

like thinking about the same thing in your body. We do in our bodies. It makes a lot of sense,

I’m just making a quick note of it honestly. And you just mentioned dogs, pets, you know, it

astounds me, especially here in the United States. So many of us have friends and family struggling

with various cancers, and we even have pets who end up suffering from cancers and other ailments,

and you know, it’s like, by gosh, why is it so many of us haven’t yet connected the dots? We’re

out there spraying chemicals like glyphosate all over our yards, and then our kids are playing

in the yards, or the neighbor’s kids, the dogs, the cats, and we’re wondering why the heck everyone’s

getting so sick. I know. And the same thing with the neonicatoids, with the bees, the bees are

pollinating those flowers. They’re treated with that pesticide and taking it back to their hive.

But with the cancer and the dog thing is, yeah, so many people have, if they usually live in HOA,

there’s like a pattern where their HOA treats their like shared graph space, and they treat it with

pesticides. And you can see little yellow flags everywhere, and it has like a little picture of a

little child and a dog, and with a huge like X through it, the thing is not safe for children or

pets to be around. And so, but that also just makes you think like, okay, it’s just not to be around

during them spraying, or like how long afterward. So using those kinds of pesticides is really like a

just throwing something out of problem and hoping that it will fix it. And it’s just really short

term, where compost tea is a long term building up the soil to do its own thing. So you don’t have

to put anything on yourself, really. Just a little hint and foreshadow. One of the

projects and campaigns that the Y and Earth community is working on that will be deploying in

the coming months is actually specifically for HOAs, folks living in HOAs, whether you own or rent,

because we’re seeing so much trouble with these chemical issues and other restrictions on

people’s ability to grow food and do permaculture and this kind of stuff. We think it’s a really

important issue and actually have begun reaching out to some state level lawmakers to see what can

be done about this. So it’s something it’ll be coming and maybe we’ll have an opportunity to

collaborate on that. Yeah, some states have banned pesticides or counties, cities, right? It’s like

little here and there, but it’s definitely not everywhere. Like there’s pesticides spraying all over

the bowl there, so here, so. Just surprising. What strikes me as a bit nuts, and you know,

I kind of understand where this has come from culturally, but it still strikes me as a bit nuts,

is that with our HOA fees, we’re often spending so much money on these pesticides that are ultimately

undermining our health and the health of our pets, our families. So it really is a cycle that

we can break and that needs to be broken. Yeah, and some people, yes, my company has started four

years ago, so I’m still kind of in like figuring out my pricing, but I’m pretty comfortable with

what is that and people finding out how much it costs. They’re just like, wow, really? Because

pesticides and chemicals, they just really upcharge. And even if you look at the organic pesticides that

they offer, they are so expensive that no organic company is going to actually, or like pesticide

companies going to buy the organic because they’ve been using, they’re paying for that. So they’re not

going to change the whole business model just to go organic. So compost tea is a super, super affordable

way to rebuild the soil. I mean, the brewer was like an investment, but there’s other ways

other than my brewer, so we can talk about to make tea. This is great, and we’ve got some resources

for the folks who might be interested in the brewer, it’s for the commercial scale, and then also

resources for kind of do it yourself at home. But speaking of pricing, Shelby, I want to be sure

to mention that you’re offering a 10% discount in this metro front range of Denver region,

mentioned the podcast or mentioned YonEarth when you reach out to Shelby, and she’ll give you

a little discount for being part of the yonearth community to get these good microorganisms

into your yard and landscape. Yeah, definitely. You also mentioned farms. How do you work with

farms? Like, what is that? So I started brewing out of farm. I’ve got my brewer, and before I went

with the idea of spraying people’s landscapes, it was just feeding this vegetable farm. And so

vegetables are annual plants, so they need a lot more inputs fertilizers. So we would spray

around like every two, three weeks this farm, and so I got tons of experience with my brewer with

my sprayer, and doing it on like a three acre scale. We would spray like a whole tote of tea. So

there’s a lot of work, a lot of experience, and then we from there, we decided to do landscaping,

also offering that, but there’s some farmers, 63rd Street Farm, I have sprayed for them,

and then I also just make tea for them and drop it off and send it through their irrigation system.

But that’s really, there’s another smaller scale farm called Speedwell Farms that we just

sprayed the other day. So yeah, I love growing food. I also work with some urban farms in Denver.

Seeds of power, unity farm, and then frontline farming. I also spray their plots and they,

those urban farms where they have little plots of land all over the city of Denver. So it’s really

cool going and spraying there. And growing the food is a lot more rewarding or like we’re fun to

watch than like growing some people’s landscapes. I mean, I love flowers, but watching the food grow

and like me knowing that my tea is giving the food nutrients that then people eat is really,

really cool. It’s so exciting. Well, you’re performing a really important function not only in terms

of the soil fertility, but you’re also connected with all of these different community food production

projects. And here we are in the time of COVID. You might notice we’re sitting farther apart than

I ordinarily would sit with a guest. And we’re doing a little social distancing. But in this time

of COVID, it’s amazing to see this resurgence in community and family scale gardening.

Similar to what we saw during the Second World War with the Victory Garden movement.

And I’m just I’m so curious to hear from your perspective with all these folks you’re connected with.

Does it seem like there’s this burgeoning interest and activity? So I just run my company by myself.

So I can only do so much in this year. I’m already like at capacity that I was last year. So people are

really into their gardens, into the yards, their lawn, whatever it is because yes, they’re home.

And then also my roommate and I were talking this morning and there’s a seed company

called Book Tannacle, something. It’s local seed company and they sold out of all of their seeds

in 2020. Yeah, we’ve heard this about several seeds. Yeah, so so that then translates to yes,

people planning gardens and people being really excited and then them hearing about compost tea

and then calling me up and me and like, come out to my house. So yes, and then also me just going

to people’s houses. They haven’t really been interacting with people. So me going there is like a little

treat for them. Yeah, yeah, hey, it’s like talking about just the plants and all the work that they’ve

been doing. You know, they just want to like show someone. It’s great. That’s really cool.

Well, you heard it here folks. Shelby’s really busy. So if you want to take advantage of this

10% discount, you probably ought to get on it. It sounds like because it sounds like a lot of

folks are reaching out to get these goodies for their yards and landscapes. You know, there’s

this whole other layer of benefit that those of us working in the sustainability and regenerative

movement are highly aware of. And this is a carbon sequestration as it relates to soil. So what

does your product and service do in terms of carbon sequestration? So when soil is dead, right,

doesn’t have any living organisms in it, the carbon is not being stored or recycled. So the

soil food web is like a huge web of microorganisms constantly recycling carbon. And so that carbon

gets to a certain point where it’s so decomposed that it can’t be decomposed anymore and it’s called

humus. And those are the huge soil, carbon reservoirs in the soil, in the humus. And fungi is really

important in that carbon sequestration. And fungi is something that is not hard to encourage growth,

but it’s something that I think it’s been stigmatized. People see a mushroom in their garden,

like get that out of here, you know, when actually we need those, the fungi plays a critical,

critical role in the soil and carbon sequestration. So my product, yeah, it’s just pretty much I’m

feeding that web of microbes or if there aren’t any microbes, I’m spraying them and creating a

community of microbes in the soil so that then they can get to work and just do what they do naturally

storing carbon because that’s the natural system and what we’re doing is constantly digging up the

dirt to do agriculture or really anything, you know, construction that completely disturbs all the

microbes and the fungus that are storing that carbon and then it just gets really second to the air.

So keeping in the ground is not hard with the right regenerative practices.

Yeah, this is, it’s so important and, you know, one of the things I’d love to emphasize is this

foundational fundamental importance of soil and you mentioned the word humus and our word human

comes from the same root. That’s cool. As do humor and humility, right? So the

working I go together. And, you know, with respect to our climate, this amazing climate, we have

a relatively stable set of temperatures on this planet because there’s carbon in the atmosphere

and prior to the industrial revolution, we had about 280 parts per million. Now we have well over

400 parts per million because we’ve burned so much fossil fuel and because we’ve been killing off

so much soil through chemicals. And so this is by working with organics and by working with

compost tea and working with you, we can actually turn our yards into sequestration reservoirs

for carbon to help mitigate the climate crisis that we’re facing. Yeah, and there’s soil everywhere,

you know, it’s, it’s a bunda and also what’s important is the sequestration they didn’t really

mention is plants. They, you know, are absorbing our carbon dioxide and giving us oxygen. So

they are fundamental, but without the microbes having a relationship with the plants, they can’t

store the carbon. So, yeah. Yes. Growing plants is the great way to store carbon, too.

Absolutely. I love this, Shirley. I got it thrown in, too, by the way. I can kind of geek out.

I’ll just stuff a little bit that you mentioned. Some people don’t like when they see a mushroom popping

up in the yard. And I get excited. I’m sure you do, too. It’s such a thing to celebrate,

generally. And there’s a particular species known as a garden giant that Paul Stamets speaks of,

that’s a great decomposer of wood chips and other matter like that to help build soil. And a lot

of times we can actually deliberately infuse or inoculate with certain species that are going to

further accelerate this soil building process, right? So I’ll show you, I have a product from Paul

Stamets. It’s a soluble, micro-risal powder called microgrove. And that’s what I use in the tea.

And yeah, he’s amazing. And there are tons of strains of mycelium that are beneficial for the soil.

And here in Colorado, it’s really important because the soil is so dry and fungus loves moisture.

So there actually isn’t a lot of fungal soils here except when you go into like the forest, right?

So making fungal teas is something I’ve been really experimenting with with people helping them

suppress weeds and just grow better lawn because they don’t have the fungus in the soils and mushrooms.

And like it’s really the spores that I’m spraying. And then it’s not guaranteed. It’s not like if I spray

a mushroom’s going to come up, right? It’s not guaranteed. But the mycelium is something you can’t see

in what’s actually doing tons of the work under the soil. And then the mushroom’s just like a little flower

of that so you can see it. But yeah, I’ve been makingemic tons of fungal teas.

What I recently talked to about with a landscaper who I was just we were walking on a property

that I was doing is that she thinks that people storing carbon in their landscapes is like the most

important. Not that storing carbon in the farms isn’t, but there’s actually a lot. There’s tons

of lawn and landscape for people to do carbon farming and compare to getting these huge large farms

to do it, right? That makes sense. So and like mobilizing the people. And so yeah.

Shelby, you’ve shared a bunch of great resources for folks to dig into around these topics. And of

course, one is your own website, edafixolutions.com. And we’ll have all this in the show notes in

terms of spelling and make it easy for you all. Another great resource is toilfoodweb.com.

And then there’s composttlab.com and greaterertherorganics.com. I want to be sure to mention too that

you’re really active on social media. And you can find Shelby on Instagram at edafixolutions. And

Facebook is edafixolutions. So hopefully you can find lots of easy and good ways to connect with her

as we’re all helping to restore and regenerate soil together wherever we’re located.

So I want to ask you about the research side of this. And it kind of ties into a couple of these

websites. What’s the deal with the research in the soil microbes and how that’s evolved over

the last couple of decades. And how that has kind of affected you in your career path.

So we got first introduced to compost tea in really soil science in this way of like living

organisms through my firm culture course. And this woman Elaine Ingham was brought up and she

is the owner of soil food web ink. And she’s pretty much devoted her life to not only

figuring, identifying the microorganisms, organisms in the soil, but doing it for people

all over the world. Like you can send your test results of your compost tea or your soil

to her lab and they will tell you about all the beneficial bacteria or non-beneficials, you know.

And that’s like a really important part of me making compost tea. And so she actually made my

brewer with the man, his name is Bob Paastima and he’s with Greater Earth Organic Sackam. We’ll see

my brewer later. But he worked really closely with her to make sure that he was making the best

possible brewer to actually extract living organisms. Because that’s what is usually the hardest part

is getting the microorganisms to separate from the compost particles, especially the fun guy

because they’re like wrapped around the compost particles. So my brewer scientifically

extracts the most life out of the compost than like any brewer on the market because of him

working with Elaine. And then so Elaine Ingham has also a bunch of courses online that you can

take and you can for compost tea, compost and the microscope courses. And so I haven’t completed

all of them but I have done some of her courses. And she’s just a great resource. She has the

compost tea brewing manual and also what I found since brewing in 2016 is that the research

and experimentation is always changing with this, right. Like in the beginning of making tea,

they thought that molasses was super beneficial and then they’re finding that oh maybe you don’t

need molasses. And then she’s the one who really put me on to making the fungal teas because

bacteria is the easiest thing to extract. Like bacteria is found everywhere. But the fun guy is

actually what takes the effort to extract. So I always just referenced to her what she’s doing

because she’s super active in it and it’s always changing. Just like the science about our microbes

in our body is becoming like a new trend, right. People drinking kombucha is the same way microbes

in the soil. For a while they didn’t think that plant interacted with the microbes as intensely

or as importantly as they did. And that really did change with the technology of microscopes and

being able to replicate these organisms in the lab because that’s the hardest part is getting

these soil microbes to show up under a microscope. So some of them like you know they I don’t know

what the number is but we haven’t even identified like made a dent in the microorganisms that exist

in the soil. And even in water too that’s like a whole other world. And then the other compost

tea lab is more of like at home. Like if you want to brew at home you have a small garden. He

sells little kits and like five gallons or in a little bigger than that compared to my 215 gallons

that you can just do it at home. And so he has tons of good resources and just really makes it

easy for people because some people see my brewer and they’re like whoa this is like kind of a big

investment to do that but if you just want to do it at home it’s definitely possible. And people

have been making compost tea forever if it’s not really a new thing. It’s really in a way it’s an

indigenous and folk knowledge that’s been around for a long time. And let it even just people make

teas just letting it sit there right not even air-rating it. So those are different types of

fermentation teas that you can make. So yeah the world is vast in microbes.

You know I love it my sense is that the explosion in scientific understanding around the micro world,

the microbiome is perhaps as significant as the explosion around telescopes and space in the

16th and 17th centuries. It is absolutely amazing and you’re right it’s as much about our own

health and well-being through our gut microbiome as it is through the soil microbiome.

And I was blown away to learn that in the soil microbiome there are organisms all of all of which

are too small to see with the naked eye. There are organisms a thousand times bigger than other

organisms. So imagine you’re in this world where there’s creatures a thousand times as big as

you and that’s what’s going on in any handful of living soil. It’s so easy for people to not think

it’s important or to even think about it at all because it’s under our feet you’re not seeing it

but I like to call it like a galaxy under our feet just like there is a galaxy in space.

Perfect there’s a lot more living in our feet than up in space.

It reminds me of a wonderful one of my favorite quotes from Leonardo da Vinci. He said

in the Renaissance over 500 years ago we know more about the stars overhead than the soil underfoot

and maybe now we’re getting to a point where we’ll kind of catch up with it.

Yeah I think so because of the benefits the health benefits of not only in our bodies

if we’re talking about kombucha and you know sauerkraut and fermented foods

but then we’re finding out wow our plants love this our soil loves this so it is slowly but

surely people are really waking up to that living everything around us is living right there’s

like microbes all of our bodies all the time and we’re not separate from it at all.

Well I am I’m so excited about this and I want to say that you know I get a bit passionate

and feel a sense of urgency around this soil regeneration issue not only because of the climate

crisis and the need for carbon sequestration but also because we have essentially been

waging chemical warfare on our own bodies and on the planet for close to 100 years now.

It’s time to stop and we’ve got to do these different better practices many of which go back to

folk and indigenous life ways and I think Shelby what you’re doing is is an absolute gift

to our community. I hope a lot of folks in this region are going to reach out to you and take

advantage of this 10% discount you’re offering that’s awesome and I hope a lot of folks in farther

away localities will reach out to you if they’re thinking they might want to starve.

Yeah I do I have had lots of people ask me on Facebook Instagram you know how much you charge

just and then like my website and because they’re so inspired to like yes this would be a great

business model you know that’s I I didn’t just come up with this idea at all right like that’s I

met other people who were doing it and inspired me to start it in Boulder so that’s just the way

to do it is inspire people and empower them to do things themselves. I love it it’s a whole ecosystem

of inspiration. Yes it also what was I mentioned is the fertilizer I’ve been writing a business

plan for my business and so I’ve been doing tons of fertilizer industry research the fertilizer

industry is a 19 billion dollar industry so that is really why we are like stay stuck in these

chemical salt based fertilizers is because it’s a huge huge industry that lots of people are

tied to so changing that is like really overwhelming but I think I can get like a little flipper

ahead in there get couple of tea at that there so absolutely right and we can do this as communities

all over and that’s really important to understand the scale of of what we’re dealing with.

Yes well think uh speaking of ecosystems of inspiration I want to give a quick shout out to

all of the folks in our YonEarth community who have joined our monthly giving program to help

support our podcast series and the rest of our community mobilization work a huge thanks to

each of you if you’d like to check it out and if you want to join at certain levels you’ll leave

and get monthly shipments of the waylay waters CBD infused aroma therapy soaking salts as a thank

you so you can check all that out at yonearth.org also want to give a big shout out to our sponsors

and this includes earth coast productions the Lidge Family Foundation Patagonia Purium

earth water press and of course waylay waters thanks to everybody we’re all in this together and

hopefully more and more of us are having fun incorporating these opportunities and transitions

into our yards our neighborhoods and our lives so I know we’re we’re going to show some

hands-on demonstration stuff Shelby um is there anything else you want to mention here before we

go outside and take a look at your gear. I just want to say that soil is exciting like people get

really excited about soil and plants and I just hope that that keeps um catch not I feel like

especially during these times like I said people are more than ever in the dirt and really like oh

what’s going on here and educating people is like a huge part of my job and I love it so much

and I want to do it forever. Well thanks Shelby so we’ll go outside now and we won’t take it by

yet we’ll do that out there but come join us outside everybody. Walk us through what you’re doing.

Yeah so I’m filling my tea bag huge tea bag with compost so

so the most important thing about compost tea is getting really high quality compost so and also

making sure you know if you are going to use your own compost making sure you composted

correctly because once I put it in there I can start breeding pathogens if there’s pathogens

found in the compost so um I buy all plant-based compost from the guy who actually made my

machine here so it’s like it has all of the beneficial organisms I’m looking for to extract

and I’ve actually been using this compost ever since I started brewing so since 2016 so every single

place I’ve sprayed has gotten some of this compost on it yeah and also it’s um you’ll sometimes

see some compost has tea grade on it because it means that they filter it in a certain way

so it’s not all like sandy and filthy so the compost won’t go through the bag

it’s very it’s important to get really high quality compost which actually

it’s surprisingly sort of hard to find locally finding a company that I can buy from so

that’s why source out course so I’m almost done filling it

and some more is here and then we’ll put it in the brewer

yeah it looks like coffee grounds good compost like a super black and like spongy yeah

but there’s also other types of compost that I use to like vermicompost

so that’s really high in bacteria yeah and so if I’m making a bacterial brew I’ll use that

but like I said I’m really into making the fungal teas so this is a fungal dominant compost also

okay so now we got all that in there

this is the most important part of the brewer it’s um the guy calls it who made it the micro

deliberation chamber so you’ll see when I put yes right so the microbes are liberated

you just got to make sure you get this all the way down in there for because it will blow

this is going to be pumping air into this bag so um what will happen is I’ll put this in the

brewer but well well why he calls it the micro obliteration chamber is because air is being blown

in here because this is a dome it creates tons of bubbles in this and through the bubbles

um it creates even more pressure for the microorganisms to be released from the compost particles

and then they’re suspended into the water so

oh my pearly

thank you my calli okay so once it’s in there then I start turning it on and it’s just

plug in sort of deal and then I’ll open this chamber for air to go through

and you’ll see the water changing color once I do that because they’ll actually be going through

the compost and then we’ll add the other ingredient

so this will be a 24 hours but I also make extracts that can be made in four to six

I’ve been making way more of those for people the cheaper so they take as much time

I it’s just not adding sugar to it too so no

yeah see right it sounds like a little

jacuzzi noise such old bill I was like it’s gonna sound like a vacuum okay so

so now I’m gonna add um they’re called microbial foods and so that’s what’s gonna feed the microbes

so that they can then multiply and reproduce so the first thing I’m putting in

is seaweed cream so it’s just soluble kelp and kelp is really really high in nitrogen phosphorus

potassium also has like 60 trace minerals in it and vitamins and amino acids so it’s also just

tons of people just use kelp as a fertilizer so adding it to the tea is great so

so my little measurement you just add that

and then the next thing is humic acid so humic acid is like the

uh most like basic form of carbon um so it helps the soil like structure

um sort of change in itself um so helps soil retain a lot more water

um and nutrients

and so I’m gonna fill this all the way up

and then add that to the tea

okay yeah really like and yeah after after a group of 24 hours it will get really rich um so the

the 24 hour tea is much different than extract um it will stick out these surfaces better

and so I’m gonna spray their trees tomorrow and um yeah I like to make the 24 hour one and then

last but not least this is what I’ll talk about the Paul Stammett um it’s called microgrow it’s

soluble microreze so that is a very beneficial fungi that’s found in the soil um he also has

there’s like two types of in here endo and ecto microreze beneficial bacteria

and other biological disease organisms so this is a really nice little um mix of

microreze to put in the tea and I know it’s coming from a really good source Paul Stammett

is a really reputable mycology um and that’s what I really care about is putting good ingredients

in my tea um put a couple scoops of that and that will help extract the fungi and then also

it will just these are just fungal spores that will be sprayed so that’s it that’s all that’s

gonna go in this batch but you can make tons of different types of compost teas um that’s just

a really basic yeah it’s like a it’s like a bacterial and fungal balance tea

because all the ingredients that I put in like the their foods for the microbes and

the fungi like to eat some and the bacteria do and and you can see like the little bubbles in

there is respiration happening yeah we’re gonna plant in here

yeah let me know should I keep going

So, this is what I say, Shelby, thanks for joining us on the…

Thank you for having me and coming and being what I do.

Thank you so much and getting the word out.

Absolutely.

So important.

Super important.

Everybody be sure to check out the Daphne solutions.

Thank you so much for the good.

Get on with the fiber of my own parts.

Well, guys, that was great!
