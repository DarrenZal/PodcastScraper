Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. I’m your host, Aaron Perry, and today we’re

visiting with Lem Tingley, the CEO and CGO of growing spaces. That CGO Chief Growing

Officer. Lem, it’s great visiting with you. Great to be here, nice to have you. We’re

so excited to get to experience the inside of your domes and share with our

audience a bunch of the specifics as to how you’re helping people in

communities all over grow a lot more food right in their own yards, right in

their own neighborhoods. And of course we’ve also got some special discounts if

you’re interested in getting a dome through growing.growingspaces.com. So we’ll

get to all that information for folks. But first let me tell people a little

about your background. So Lem grew up outside Boston, Massachusetts and came to

Colorado every year as a kid for ski vacations. So you fell in love with the

Rocky Mountain West at an early age. He attended the University of

Colorado in Boulder and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, which

led to working for the last 25 years in manufacturing both in Colorado and

offshore. Lem is married to his wife Liz and they live in Golden Colorado with

their three teenage boys. I guess you guys are busy. And so he shared with us that

he was laid off from his previous job in engineering and felt like it was a

good opportunity to either start or purchase a company in some sort of

sustainable technology. And so having heard of growing spaces through his brother

in law and having learned that the founder owners were retiring and selling

their business, Lem and Liz jumped on it. And they immediately came down to

Pugosa Springs, which is where we are, to meet Udgar and Pooja Parsons. And you’ll

get to see a little interview with them later on the founders. And they fell in

love with them and what they had created in this small town in Colorado. So Lem

and his wife purchased growing spaces in April of 2018 and are now expanding

the company organically. And Lem, it’s just it’s such a joy to know a bit about

your story, how you got here and what you’re what you’re doing now with the

company going forward. And I guess let me just first start by asking what was it

about, you know, Colorado that caused you to fall in love with this place.

Yeah, I was a big skier growing up back east and you know you have to learn to

just be on ice back there. So that’s all you get is big, you know, blue ice. So

coming out to Colorado every week with Utah, Wyoming, every year, I was just a

joy. And I remember one year, I think junior year in high school, we came to

Brecht for a week in February, how to date every day, just skiing powder

every day. And my parents talked me into visiting CU Boulder on the way back to

the airport. On the way back, we visited Boulder. It was 70 degrees in sunny

in the middle of February. Kids were outside in their shorts, playing frisbee,

just having a ball. And you know, I love hiking and biking and all that. So it

just felt like just a beautiful environment to be at and study and then also get

to get some skiing in at the same time. So it was purely for selfish reasons. But

I’ve never regretted it and never moved out of Colorado since until 18. Yeah, yeah.

I think that’s a familiar story for a number of us. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to

me. Well, you know, I’m so interested to hear more about your your

engineering background and how you’re going to apply that in our applying that to

improve some efficiencies in your manufacturing process. And you know, these

domes are extraordinary. They’re extraordinarily strong structures. They create

these growing environments in cold climates where we can grow tropical and

subtropical plants. So maybe can you just give us an overview of where we are

right now and what growing spaces is making available to people? Yeah,

absolutely. We’re here in Pagosa Springs. Growing spaces has six different sizes

domes that we sell. We’re currently in the 33-foot diameter dome, which is our

second biggest size later today. I’ll show you some 42-foot domes that we have

down at the geothermal partnership. But we have all the other smaller sizes here

on site ranging from 15 feet all the way up to the 42 feet. So this is our second

biggest dome. We get a lot of food gardening space in here. Behind us, you see

water tank. This is basically the battery of the system. It acts as a thermal

mass, both in the summertime to help keep the dormant dome cool and humid. And in

the winter time, the sun will reflect off that reflectic insulation, keep the

pond during the day, and then a night emit that heat back out and keep your

plants warm and moist all night long, all winter long, without any external heat.

So you don’t need any electricity, propane, as long as you’re doing cross-party

plants in the winter time. If you want to do tropicals, grow tomatoes, year-round,

you can. You just need to add a little bit of heat to your dome during the cold

response. Yeah. But otherwise, you’re growing year-round without any additional

possible. It’s amazing. And you told me beforehand that you guys have domes in

every state. Is that correct? That’s correct. Yeah. Over the 30-year history of

growing spaces, we’ve shipped probably about 3,000 domes to all 50 states,

about 15 countries across the globe. The dome definitely works best in the Rocky

Mountain climate here in Colorado, about half our sales are here in Colorado.

Because of the extreme weather, we use a five-log poly, which is really as a high

R value, almost three, as well as the snow-resistant, hail-resistant, and just the

shape of the geodesic dome, the Buckminster Fuller dome, really is good

against the wind. It really just pushes the dome back down into the earth, so

you’re never going to have your rectangular greenhouse get hit by a flat

surface and get blown off your property. The way it goes. A lot of

dome owners calling it. My greenhouse is in my neighbor’s yard, right? We need

something a little more wind-resistant. Oh, the geodesic shape is perfect. But the

real value of it is it tracks the sun all day long. You get nice, even sun for

your plants all day long. You don’t have any flat surfaces when you make your

plants during the new day sun, and you just get nice, even sun throughout the day.

It’s another great tool to do this shape. Yeah, well this is so wonderful. So a

little later on, we will visit with one of your gardeners and educators, Heather

Gray, talking about soil and how to care best for the plants in this kind of

environment. And then later we’re actually going to go over to Pagosa High

School and visit with the principal over there. And they’re building a dome right

now for their students, right? I’m really excited about that. Yeah, they’re

building a 42-foot dome for their students, both their vocational students and

their culinary arts students. Yeah, that’s really awesome. They’re given those

students that kind of exposure and experience so early on in their

professional lives really. Yeah, yeah. And then after that we’ll visit with the

founders of this company, Pujan, Udgar Parsons, who have been real pioneers in

this whole sustainability movement for for several decades. So it’s going to be a

real treat. I think the way we get to flow through these different pieces of

the podcast today. Yeah, I’m really excited to meet with Udgar and Udgar. They’ve

been retired for the last two years, but still involved down there with the

domes of the geothermal projects. So we’re doing great work down there for the

community and the local food hubs. So I’m excited to meet with them as well. Yeah,

that’s super exciting. Well, let me let me ask this, you know, these structures,

you know, take some money and one thing we want to be sure to mention to our

audience is that if you mention YonEarth when you connect with growing

spaces, you can connect by growingspaces.com or if you click through the

growing spaces logo anywhere from the YonEarth web ecosystem, our

partnership and sponsor page or our podcast page, you will get a 5% discount

when you get your dome and demand has been so high in large part because of

COVID, it seems that production is out several months. So if you are thinking

about getting a dome, it’s a really good idea to connect with lemon as team soon

to get in the queue. But, you know, one of the things that jumped right out at

Mealem with the information that you sent over is that you guys are not only

selling these domes, you’re doing amazing work with education on YouTube and

through your Facebook groups. And you’re also working with low income

communities and with the Navajo Nation, for example, and you’re doing some

special grants in urban and low income communities related to the Black Lives

Matter movement. And I just, if you would, just speak to that kind of community

service work that you guys are doing because I think it’s extraordinary.

It’s really exciting. I’m excited to be at this point. We’ve had on the business

for two years and our sales were pretty flat from when we took over the

business those first two years. So we were really just trying to pay off our

loans and forgets. And so we didn’t have a lot of, you know, money left over to

kind of do the charitable projects. But when my wife and I bought the business,

we really had the long-term goal to put a portion of our profit back into the

community. So COVID has really been, I mean, it’s been horrible for the world

and the nation, but it’s really is teaching people the value of controlling

their own food source. Be able to go into their backyard and pick their vegetables

for lunch or for dinner, as well as have a nice sanctuary just like we are here

to sit and relax. So the phone’s been ringing off the hook since March. We are

booked out several months. But the benefit of that for us is we’re able to give

back. And so we have one-dome plan for Navajo Nation, like you mentioned. They’ve

been really impacted by COVID. And they’re very family-oriented. And that’s part

of the reason why it’s spread. But they really want to try to get back to their

roots of farming and growing their own food and being self-sustainable. Because

they’ve kind of lost that part of their culture. They’re a Navajo Nation. And

even, you know, we really are in a food desert. They don’t have access to fresh

organic food. So we’ve met some people down there. The founders of Garam Pooja

had built a couple of domes down there as well, who are really trying to bring

back local farming, local family farms to the community. So we’ve donated one of

our 26-foot greenhouses to Navajo Nation. We do have a fundraiser that we

link to from our website to help with the some of the site prep, the bed

materials, the soil, everything else that goes into that project. It’s on their

our Facebook page right now. But another project I’m really excited about that

we started before COVID was with a local veterans community called Matterville

Vets. And they’re based in the Denver area. And they have two communities, one in

Sedalia and one in Hartsell, Colorado. What they’re doing is building tiny

home sustainable communities for veterans with PTSD to kind of give them a

place to really a sanctuary for them to really recover, as well as grow their

own food, do their own work around the property and really be awkward and

sustainable. And one unique thing about that project is they’ve adopted some

wolves from a wolf from Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge that were the owner

retired. And so now they’ve paired the vets with PTSD with the wolves. So the

wolves are trained to comfort the vets. They have nightmares and it’s just an

amazing place. My kids and I have been up there to help build pens and kind of

get the property in Sedalia built up. And then the next step is to start doing

the site prep and we’ve donated a 26-foot greenhouse for them as well. So they

could grow their own food year round. Wow. Yeah, Matterville Vets. So we’re really

excited about that project. Yeah, and there’s quite a bit of research coming out

about how working with soil and working with plants really helps with PTSD.

And there are different veterans communities doing these sorts of gardening

projects for that very reason. The neuro biochemistry is affected and it just

allows people people’s nervous systems to calm down. Right. Which is so

important. Right. It’s so important for, yeah, special needs kids and

education. We’ve had examples and when we go down to the GGP dome and the

education dome of special needs kids who really do just calm down when they

enter the dome. Get their hands dirty. This is night and day. So it’s really

exciting to be part of this project. Yeah, it’s really beautiful. Well, in just

spending some time in the Pagosa community today, it’s clear this is a this is a

really tight knit community. And what you guys are doing here as a local

manufacturer providing jobs and all of that is also a great benefit to the

local economy. Yeah, so when we do hire a lot of veterans, we have a lot of

veterans on staff. We’ll visit the vocational school where they’re building the

dome. We really hope to use that program to hire new kids because what happens

here in Pagosa is a lot of kids that go out of high school and then they leave

town. Yeah, and there’s a huge gap in the workforce. There is a lot of

construction in town. So there’s a lot of construction jobs. There’s a lot of

restaurant jobs, huge tourist industry, but there is a gap in that kind of

millennial range of good workforce. So we’re trying to bring in people not only

to help the manufacturer the domes and install the domes, but gardeners, sales

people, and our sales people are gardeners. So we can really kind of help our

customers through the learning experience when it comes to growing in a new

dome because the technology really sells itself. We’re not really sales

people. Everybody but me here is a gardener. I can’t say that I’m a gardener,

but I’m learning. You’re a gardener in training. I’m a gardener in training, and that’s why I’ve

lined up Heather and Ugar and Pooja to kind of help kind of talk about the

gardening aspect of the dome. That’s great. I’m learning and I’m learning in our

dome in Golden as well. And you know, it was wonderful to recently have the

opportunity to interview my good buddy Brian Dillon with his dome up in the

mountains. And he was sharing that the the Facebook groups are this

amazing online community where people are sharing information and you guys are

active. And I’m just curious if you might describe for our audience a little

bit kind of what’s going on in that ecosystem. Yeah, absolutely. We have two

Facebook groups. One’s called growing dome enthusiasts and one’s called

growing dome owners. So growing dome owners is limited to owners only. So that’s

where we get a lot of really good conversations about how the dome is

performed. You know, we talk about test problems. We talk about cooling your

dome in the summertime. We talk about heating your dome in the winter. If

you’re going to heat your dome in the winter, different ways of optimizing your

dome, they’re getting a lot into aquaponics systems, hydroponic systems,

decks built over the pond. But the growing dome enthusiast page is actually

really thriving as well. And that’s other people who are interested in purchasing

a dome are really just interested in greenhouse gardening or geodesic

technology can come and ask questions more about the planning of the

growing dome, what it takes to get through your building department, your HOA,

the foundation techniques. And we have a lot of owners on that site as well,

giving advice to future owners. And then we’re always monitoring and making

sure, you know, their questions are getting answered. But it’s very low touch

for us because we have a huge community of growing dome owners who are on those

pages, helping our customers out. As well as nationally, if they’re not in

Colorado and don’t have the ability to come to either Golden or Pagosa to see a

dome, they can ask, hey, I’m in Pennsylvania. Does anybody have a dome I can see?

And people will raise their hands and say, yeah, come check out my dome.

Yeah, it’s a really good community. Yeah, absolutely. You know, speaking of

community, one of the things we’ve been observing through the Winers Community

Network in this time of COVID, as more and more people are gardening and wanting

to take back more control over their food supply, we’re seeing in many HOAs

and in many, you know, apartment complexes and so forth. A lot of folks don’t

have the ability to garden. In some HOAs, we’re seeing that it’s essentially

required to spray poisons to kill things like dandelions, right, which is

really sad and makes no sense. And I know you and I have begun a

conversation around some of the efforts that YonEarth is cooking up to help

kind of move the HOA frameworks forward so that we’re not poisoning our

kids and our pets in our communities and we’re making gardening a more central

aspect of our American culture. And I’m curious with the domes, what kind of

issues you’ve been running into with different HOAs out there? Yeah, really

similar issues. I mean, HOA boards kind of see the dome as a very unique

structure. They’re non rectangular, so they kind of look different. So anytime

you have a community, so that doesn’t look right, they’re not going to allow it

in the community regardless of what it’s for. But you mentioned my brother-in-law

who kind of turned us on to growing spaces. When he first went to his HOA, they

did reject him, 100% of the board rejected him. And then growing spaces actually

helped them with the presentation to really talk about the benefit of the dome,

what he was trying to accomplish. He’d had a stroke, his life has health issues,

so growing healthy organic food year-round was a real benefit to their own health.

He showed pictures of inside the dome and the vegetables, and he went back with

that information, and they approved it unanimously. So as soon as they kind of

learned what the dome was for and really the beauty of the entire structure and

the inside of the dome, they approved it. So we really do help our customers

try to navigate that HOA process and really talk about the benefits of the dome.

Yeah, it seems so important that a lot of what we’re running into with barriers

and roadblocks is a matter of education, huh? And presenting the information in a way that’s

not threatening and explains benefits. Yeah, exactly. We had a dome owner from the Ukraine actually

who came to the US and in the Ukraine. Everybody’s front yard, everybody’s back yard was a garden.

And she came to the US and saw all these green grass everywhere. And so where do you

grow your food? I don’t understand. And so they bought a huge property up in Bailey, Colorado,

huge gardens, a traditional greenhouse as well as a 42-foot growing dome, and they’re just

growing life-raising. She’s actually a chef at a local restaurant, so she grows from a restaurant.

Oh wow, it’s a really good story. I know there’s a lot of organizations out of boulders that are

really working on turning transition people’s yards into gardens so we can have more local food

sources. And then like you said, we need to eliminate the rest of the silence around.

Right, yeah, absolutely. You know, and I think it’s so important to stress, to emphasize this

connection between local, fresh, organic food and maintaining our health and well-being

and avoiding disease. And you know, we have so many folks in our culture suffering from all kinds

of diseases. Well, a lot of the times the food that we’re eating is so disconnected from the

healthy soil and so on. It’s critical that we make that connection very close a part of everyday

life and it seems that the domes make that possible in a lot of different contexts to the people.

Absolutely. It all starts with the soil. When we meet Heather, she’ll talk about what she’s

done in our domes with the soil. We made a transition in March when when COVID first hit, our domes

used to be really about the beauty of the dome and the variety of the dome. You could really grow

anything you want in these, but we made a shift to really focus on production. The food hubs

were struggling here even before COVID because it is a food desert here in Pagosa. We just did

get a natural grocer, so we’re all excited about that. I hear in Pagosa, but we’re donating all the

food from these five domes into local food hubs and she’s been really, she’s really done a great job

transitioning the domes to optimize production of fruits and vegetables. Are you finding there’s a

particular fruit or vegetable that seems to just thrive and produce a ton in the food? We already

say tomatoes. We’ve put a tomato on our logo because it just takes take off. I’ve seen tomatoes just

all take over some dollars. Apparently you have to trim them every day. And when we go down to the

geothermal project, they’re doing really well with their tomatoes as well. We always say tomatoes

are doing doing amazing, but so much so many other things thrive. Swiss charred olives, those

kale, grapes, grapes are great because they provide natural shade to the dome and then you can train

them up on the southwest side to really provide some additional natural shade as well as natural

transportation. The more vegetation you have in the dome, you’ll just feel the energy, you’ll feel

the moisture come off the plants. It’s a really nice environment. It really does feel like you’re in

control. Yeah, I love it. And I’m just observing that the charred you have over here in next

dude, it looks like romaine. These plants look picture perfect. I mean, they look so happy. Yeah,

and we’ve been harvesting them like crazy, so it’s amazing. I think it’s amazing. I think we’ve got

some carrots over here, everything you can do really well. Beautiful. It’s really exciting. Well,

and I notice also the rosemary just thrives. And I’ve tried rosemary a bunch of years in

Colorado, and often during the winter months, even if you’re bringing them inside, if they’re

potted, they tend not to do so well, but here they are just jamming. It’s beautiful. Yeah, we’re

very sage-both. Yeah. All kinds of herbs, microbeurings go real well, and you can turn them really

quick, part of the stem, really quick as well. We have a lot of chefs doing microgreens on the

herbs for the restaurants as well. Yeah, that’s so wonderful. Yeah. Well, let me just take this

opportunity to remind our audience that this is the Y on Earth community podcast, and today we’re

visiting with Lim Tigley, the chief growing officer of growing spaces. And I want to thank our

sponsors and give a shout out to the folks who are helping to make this podcast episode possible,

as well as our community mobilization work for soil regeneration, climate action, health and

wellness, neighborhood resilience, and culture kindness. And that includes Earth Coast productions.

In fact, I’ll give a shout out to Artim Nichol Cobb, the owner of Earth Coast. He’s manning the

cameras here for us today. And that includes also the LIDGE Family Foundation. Purium, of course,

growing spaces, and go to growingspaces.com, mention YonEarth, to get a discount.

Soil works, earth water press, and wheylay waters. And of course with wheylay waters,

the CBD infused aroma therapy soaking salts. If you go to yunerf.org slash wheylay dash waters,

you can join the monthly giving program at certain levels and receive monthly shipments of those

soaking salts for your health and well-being. So that’s a wonderful additional bonus there. And then

I want to give a special shout out as well to all the folks who have joined our monthly

giving program at a variety of different levels. And we really appreciate your support.

And everything that we’re doing here is a community effort and is being done on the strength of our

relationships and connecting with leaders like Yulem who are making so much available to folks.

And it’s really such a joy sitting in this space. And I’m wondering, I imagine there must be times

when business can get little stressful at times. And I imagine maybe you might just come out

here sometimes just to be in the dome and be with the plants. Is that part of the experience?

Absolutely. It’s just so relaxing to be in here and just pick some fresh beans off the vine

and taste them while you just sit here and relax and read a book, even make some phone calls in

the dome. It’s just such a relaxing space to be in. It’s amazing. I’m just so thankful to be a part of

it. And you’re very fortunate to come across this business and be able to be a part of it.

Yeah, it’s so beautiful. Well, I’m wondering, should we take a pause on our conversation here and

go visit with Heather and see what she’s doing with the soil and the plants?

Yeah, absolutely. I’ll give you a tour and we’ll meet Heather.

Cool. And then we’ll meet back up here, huh?

Okay. Sounds good. Great.

So hey folks, here we are. We’re in the 18-foot dome and we’re visiting with Heather Gray

who is an educator and gardener par excellence here at Growing Spaces. And so Heather, I’m so excited

for you to share with us some of your techniques, what you’re doing with soil and what you’re doing

with ventilation to maintain super healthy and productive plants here in these domes.

Well, we started with really good soil, alpaca manure and the bedding of the alpacas.

And it wasn’t fully broken down, so we treated it with and continued to treat with

mycorrhiza and good bacteria and fish emulsion and seaweed and proper watering. You know,

not too much, not too little. And just keep it in a healthy environment and slowly, slowly,

it builds to lots and lots of armies. Oh yeah, I see some right there.

Yeah. Beautiful. Are you sure of the camera? Yeah.

There’s small little red wigglers maybe. Yeah, there’s night crawlers in there too.

Okay. But you’ll see them when you go to the 33. Uh-huh.

But you see it’s broken down. It used to be like wood chips and it kind of drained through,

but now it holds water really well. Yeah. And in most cases, people can heal their hydrophobic soil

with this method. You know, sometimes they have to start with a wetting agent. Yep.

But um, which is like usually with Dr. Bronner soap and water kind of thing. Okay.

But then watering in good bacteria, mycorrhiza, um, keeping it moist all the time. So never too

much water enough, not too little. And um, and then good nutrients, you know, building up good by

and multi-biotics. If you can get your hands on way, you know, if you know a local cheese maker,

um, I’ve seen people get very creative with getting probiotics in their sooner. But slowly,

slowly you build a structure and it starts breaking down that material and holding moisture again.

So with the probiotics from like a living crowd, or can she be helpful for soil?

I’ve seen people do it. Wow. They water it down though because of the acidic. Yeah.

The lactobacolus. Yeah. So, um, unless you’re starting with like a really alkaline, like in Colorado,

you know, clay bays. Yeah. Alkaline soil. You could, um, lower the pH by doing something like that.

Yeah. Interesting. And so hydrophobic soil, um, obviously phobic like phobia means the soil doesn’t

like the water, the hydropart. So either drains off or goes straight through. Yeah. So what causes

that in the first place? The soil has died either in extents or like fully died,

where there’s no good bacteria or good fungus in there and the bacteria is what holds the water

in the soil. That’s what like kind of makes it like a sponge. And when the bacteria dies from

not being watered for an extents of period of time or from being solarized, you know, from being

cooked essentially, um, then the soil isn’t alive anymore. It’s basically dust at that point. I

don’t even call it soil at that point. So sometimes dust can be made into soil, but not all the time.

Interesting. Well, this soil is clearly alive and these plants seem amazing. They’re just thriving

and we just ate some of the green beans and some of the tomatoes and they’re so delicious.

And you have a certain technique for how you’re you’re trimming, right?

From the bottom up, everything is really important. Yeah. And why is that so important?

Ventilation is super important and any kind of greenhouse structure. Plant, see this, how it’s

moving the leaves of the plant. So I think the primary focus of ventilation is that the leaves

of plants need to move for the cellular structure of the plant to be strong. They’re using different

methods in different agriculture now where they’re actually manually moving plants and you know,

there’s like a whipping method with plants where they you just you move it like simulate animals

walking by, simulate wind feeding it, simulate rain, pounding on it because all of that just like

people builds the cellular structure and the defenses of the plant. So for numerous reasons,

also fungal diseases that build up in growing spaces of any kind.

For numerous reasons, building the cellular structure and making that plant resilient

is primary focus. And so that’s why you’re trimming from bottom up.

The air can get through so that not a lot of moisture accumulates in the leaves so that also helps

with fungal diseases and also you know catches air and they’re kind of forced up and so they move

around a little bit when the fan is on and they’re just healthier and stronger and they get a

little air through. Yeah all these kale plants seem super healthy it’s really fun to see them I can have some thank you yeah we don’t we don’t turn down

good fresh food yeah so I I’m so thrilled and it sounds like you’re also helping to guide some

of the other gardeners on the team as to how to best take care of the soil and the plants

and that you’re also available to speak with folks who actually have domes of their own right

to help them have success and and what does that look like like what are what are some of the

situations that you hear about most often that you’re you’re helping with mostly problems that

people are having that they don’t know what to plant where or they are having a pest problem

of sometimes that they don’t know how to fix or something that they’re not familiar with like pond

plant issues or I was literally 15 minutes ago on the phone with a lady who needs fresh

so you know it could be any range of things that’s so wonderful to have that real support from

the company I think it really speaks to the the goal and the objective of folks having success

growing in their domes which is wonderful to hear yeah well I so appreciate having this time

with you Heather and I’m wondering before we sign off for the moment is there is there anything

else you’d like to mention or share with our audience if the audience includes people who grow

and domes or greenhouses or structures when you go away for the winter find a way to keep your soil

water that is the biggest thing like soil is alive just like plants it cannot be forgotten and

um you won’t be ultimately successful unless you focus on the health of your soil more than the

health of what’s up top because the root structure of the plant is where all the health of the plant

start so you heard it here from Heather don’t forget the soil especially in this in the winter

yeah yeah beautiful but thank you so much Heather my pleasure nice to meet you likewise

i’ll go get you some hair oh thanks that sounds great solem here we are we we just visited with

Heather that was just wonderful and it’s amazing to see the the incredible expertise she’s bringing

to the care for the soil and the plants here with the domes yeah she’s she’s amazing she’s been

gardening for over 25 years she was with growing spaces for a long time went off to pursue other

ventures so we were very thankful to have her back here growing spaces with us we’ve hired a

couple other younger gardeners to kind of train underneath her so you learn her techniques so she’s

been really a great mentor to them as well as well as the whole team here at growing spaces so she’s

been she’s been great so i thank her very much for taking the time yeah absolutely yeah that was

wonderful well uh you know listen i i’d love to circle back a little more on this work that you’re

doing around the black lives matter movement and uh obviously such a big issue in our culture right

now and and there’s so much healing that’s that’s needed in communities all over and it’s something

you guys are engaging as well with growing spaces huh yeah i talked about the two projects at

Navajo Nation and for for matters bill bets we started those before COVID or right about the time

COVID started so kind of before the latest phase of the black lives movement um we do work with

an organization called urban growers collective out of Chicago they actually purchased the dome right

about the time we bought the business um and we’ve been doing some in kind uh work for them

but i think they’re just a great example of how growing food locally can really improve a

community especially an urban community because you know a lot of people don’t really know but

urban communities can be food deserts as well uh you don’t have access to whole foods a lot of

times even then organic food is so expensive that those communities can afford good fresh organic

food and they find themselves eating it with donalds and maybe not the healthiest food but what

we’ve seen at urban growers collective in South Chicago is it’s really bringing the community together

in multiple aspects not only providing food to the community but providing work you know paid work

as well as volunteer work to the community um you know African-Americans and whites both are working

in the garden uh so what we want to do is we want to do more projects like that basically it was a

comes down to so we’ve offered a grant program for 2021 uh for urban communities specifically

we will be donating growing domes next year uh for urban communities so if you go to our website

you’ll get links to our our gardening grants page uh which has our grant listed as well as many

other uh gardening and community and school garden grants uh listed for these types of communities

to apply for that and then we’ll be uh working with those programs in 2021 uh to help build those

domes because um our season is going to be coming to an end here soon uh a lot of these communities are

in colder climates we prefer it to be in a colder climate just because it’s harder to grow food

year round and the dome will work better in places like South Chicago uh so we’re going to be looking

for communities in more northern climates to to work with to build growing domes so they can grow

food year round and really bring the community together that’s fabulous as you’re as you’re as you’re

describing this i’ve got a few folks coming to mind that i’ll be sure to uh get this information to

because uh this is really going to help i think a lot of different communities out there

right yeah right yeah we’re really going to try to promote it uh from here on out um we’re also yeah

like i said looking for donations for the other projects to help the site prep on things of that

nature because the dome is just a piece of that and then obviously the ongoing uh gardening aspect of

it and keeping the dome well maintained uh is important as well so i encourage you to look up urban

growers collective as well uh this is a great organization great yeah thanks for that limb

well listen i know i know we’re going to head over here in a few minutes to visit the high school

all right where they’re building the dome and we get to see some of the construction and action

and then uh after that we’ll visit with the founders uh udgar and puja downtown at the community

space there um but uh before we take off to go do that limb um is there anything else you’d like

to to say or share with our audience yeah on that regard i’m just so thankful that you guys took

the time to come down here to pagosine pose the long drives uh to come down here but this is where

the company was built um we want to remain active in this community like i said we’re donating

food to the food hubs we actively support the geothermal park project uh through in kind donations

and helping to maintain those three domes and udgar and puja really built a strong foundation

right here in pagosis springs and to have the manufacturing of the domes local here to build the

higher local resources we we buy mostly us uh components um and to have a us based

Colorado based manufacturing facility is just incredible especially here in pagosis springs and

what they’ve done in the small community is really built a national brand an international brand

right here in small town pagosis so as we grow the business internationally uh we’re also trying

to keep a very strong footprint right here in pagosis and that’s what i wanted to show you today as well

both at the high school and the geothermal project oh that’s great well thanks so much lemon it’s

wonderful visiting with you and sharing all of this with our audience great yeah no thank you again

for coming down okay so we’ll go visit a couple sites come on everybody so here we are at

pagosis high school with principal shawano donnell hello hey shawano how you doing doing great thank you

great thanks for visiting with with lemon me and telling us a bit about the uh the project you got

going on here you’re welcome glad to and uh lemon i know you you probably can kind of guide us

through the discussion here a little bit with what’s going on yeah now we’ve been working on this

project with pagosis high for a couple of years now it’s right in our hometown so we were always

really excited about it but what we’re more excited about is when it’s completed and what it’s

actually going to be used for so shawano tell us a little bit of how you’re going to use this

dome for your your vocational programs you bet so we um we’re fortunate to have a kind of a

small six-foot dome that we have here on the property and and we’ve been using it with our

ag programs they’ve been you know growing growing growing a few things in there um they do have some

hydroponics going so they’ve been fiddling with that a little bit and growing some tilapia and

into the season trying to find people to buy the tilapia or whatever but um but the time came

that we just come out growing that you know we’ve um got more demand from kids wanting to take more

agriculture classes and then we’re actually this year adding a horticulture class um but

hard to do horticulture in in our climate you know if you really want to grow anything year round so

this obviously presented itself as the the right facility to do that so um we’re excited about

opportunities that it’s going to provide our kids yeah what’s great about school domes is the

fact that the growing season here in Colorado is in the summer when kids are out of school yeah

so it’s so nice to have a year-round environment where you can teach kids horticulture in the middle

in the middle of winter absolutely yeah and then we’ve also got um our science teachers are a

little bit uh anxious to get in there also provides my opportunities besting your biology classes

and things like that to uh do some experimentation that you you really can’t do in a regular classroom

so um don’t know what those are going to be yet but i really feel like sky’s the limit on

on the opportunities to to use this facility to to expand um just opportunities for the kids

yeah so it’s so great to give them the the hands-on experience to accompany a lot of the theoretical

science that they’re learning out the books and so on absolutely it’s one thing to

see it on a video so all that other thing to actually pull it off in life and and uh

mean so much more so yeah or it’s it’s it’s a good deal for us you have some local chefs working

on the project as well right but we do teaching culinary arts as well as using it for the local

restaurants we do yeah for sure are we we’re very fortunate with Todd Stevens being our

director of our food service program he’s got some plans um you know he he helps us

that our culinary arts program um we’ve got some plans in there also to do some farm to table type

things so as that culinary arts program expands a lot of the kids kind of grow to grow their food

and that could be a um a collaboration between classes even you know the horticulture class maybe

growing some things culinary class in there and then actually harvest take that into the kitchen

and and make food out of it um and then you know i know Todd that has some ideas to do some farm to

table stuff even for the just the general food service program so um like it says on the infant

stages but i feel like sky’s the limit it’s it’s so cool from my perspective to see that you guys

have developed such a strong vocational training program here and i know talking with some other

educators and other parts of the state or even around the country that uh in many places

students don’t have those same kinds of opportunities and uh it’s it’s great you’re giving them

uh again that hands-on uh training opportunity yeah absolutely i appreciate you saying that i

a big believer in it and the vocational trades and all those all those different fields and

and giving kids those opportunities um you know i personally i’d like to um you know we try to be

mindful of our own local community and for those kids that maybe don’t want to go to college

um if we can give them some skills and some hands-on stuff while they’re in high school

that maybe they can get into those entry-level things in our community and establish themselves

but that comes from having programs you know like our ag programs the our building trades all the

different kinds of programs we’ve been adding here lately um it’s it’s it’s crucial to have those

programs for those kids yeah yeah i know we’re excited about it because yeah here are going

spaces like i said you’re in our backyard so we’re excited to be able to hire some kids out of that

program we’re sure done with it both from the construction of the domes as you can see

as well as the the gardening and the culinary aspects of it yeah for our own for our own purposes

well it’s great we’re standing here and behind us is a live build going on of the dome itself and

we can see the fellows are putting up some of the timbers there and lemma is wondering if maybe

you’d just explain real quick what we’re seeing here in the process yeah absolutely we’re actually

on the first day of the build so you can see it’s going up relatively quickly one unique thing about

this dome is the stem wall is made out of concrete so but guys that but goes to high one at the

concrete stem wall so that was here when we got here and then we anchor bolt into that and then

start on the dome build and we’re just going to go up with the struts in a spiral until we get to

the top and then after that we’ll put it on the polycarbonate glazing uh this whole build will

probably take us about five days with three crew members uh so it really goes up real quick and then
