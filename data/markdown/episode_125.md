Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast.

I’m your host, Aaron William Perry, and today we’re visiting with Danielle Ryan Broida,

the co-author of Healing Adapted Jins, the Definitive Guide to Using Super Irbs and Mushrooms

for Your Body’s Restoration Defense and Performance.

Danielle, it’s so great to visit with you.

How are you today?

Thanks so much for having me.

I’m well.

I’m excited to be here.

I’m excited for a conversation.

I actually think this is going to be one of the most important episodes that we share

with our audience because we’re going to take a dive into the world of adaptogens, herbal

medicine and medicinal mushrooms that you’ve managed to boil down to the top 21 that can

really enhance our health and well-being, and so I’m so excited to dive into the material

with you.

Right on.

They’re so important.

They’re so relevant.

And as we were chatting a little bit before the show, we’re like, we’ve tried so many

times to make this work, and for some reason it’s like this pivotal moment of stress and

weirdness and all these environmental factors that brought us together today to have this

conversation.

And we’re like, oh, there’s actually a purpose to that.

I think that ties in exactly to what we’re trying to tell the audience.

So yeah, it feels like a really fitting, important time to be having this chat.

Yeah, truly.

I agree completely.

Danielle is a registered herbalist with the American Herbalist Guild, a certified holistic

nutritionist, instructor of mycology, and national educator for four-sigmatic.

After receiving her degree in environmental studies and philosophy from Whitman College,

she studied Ayurveda in India, became a certified yoga instructor on the banks of the Ganges

River, and opened a private practice specializing in functional mushroom-based treatment for

individuals with autoimmune conditions and chronic illnesses.

Danielle has found her calling as an instructor of mycology at the Colorado School of Clinical

Herbalism, and as head of education at four-sigmatic.

She brings her passion and expertise in herbal medicine, clinical practice, teaching, formulation,

and her deep love for fungi to the everyday magic of four-sigmatic.

Danielle, yeah, it’s great.

We’ve got a lot to talk about, including, we’ll be talking about the line of products you

guys offer at four-sigmatic.

But before getting to the products, let’s talk about your book.

This healing adaptogens book, in my opinion, is one of the most important resources for

all of us to have on hand, and the reason I say this, I’ve looked at a lot of different

herbal medicine and medicinal mushroom books over the years, and many of them are so

chock full of information, largely scientific and specialized information, that for the

regular kind of day-to-day lay person to have quick access to information that helps

us understand what we can do in our own lives, is actually kind of difficult, I think,

to sift out of a lot of these resources out there, and your book, on the other hand,

boils it down so beautifully and so excessively and so concisely, and I’m flashing it on screen

here for the audience who are looking at the video.

So I just, I want to kick off talking about the books, and note that you co-authored

this book with Taro, as a copella, and who is the founder of four-sigmatic.

We’ll talk a little about his background a little later on, but just let me ask first,

what was it that compelled you to put this book together, knowing that there are so many

other resources similar already out there on the market?

Yeah, it’s a really good question.

What I found, and similar to what you mentioned, is there’s these really awesome, more medical

herbalism-focused textbooks on adaptogens that are thick and they’re rich, they’re denser

full of awesome information, but unless you have a background of a practitioner of some

sorts or an herbalist, it’s really challenging to find that user-friendly aspect to it.

I’m like, okay, well, now what?

Where do I actually source this and what kind of dosing do I need and what kind of thing

should I be looking out for in the marketplace and just really kind of that bridge between

understanding the information or maybe even having a little bit more difficult time understanding

it because it’s a lot of that deep science and research that’s not familiar to a lot of

common people who really need the benefits of what these can offer, or I started finding

that as adaptogens were really exploding in popularity, we saw, you know, a few years

ago, Oshwaganda surpassed Greenjuices in Google Search, which is crazy.

Oshwaganda is very hard to spell, you know, and it’s like, Oshwaganda, Hindi, Ayurvedic

Roots, and yet Greenjuice, and we were like, okay, there’s a need for this because it’s

becoming relevant in the public eye.

You know, I recently saw Dove did a line of adaptogen body soaps and different men’s products

using adaptogens.

I mean, they’re really starting to pop up in unexpected places.

And it was like, we have these great herbal textbooks, but not something that recent.

There are a couple decades old as well, or there’s tons of information on the internet

that a lot of it, frankly, was inaccurate, or not backed by research.

And so I’m like, okay, there’s got to be some middle ground, you know, for someone that

really loves the research and wants to dive in and wants to know what clinical trials

are out there, but also wants to just start using this and say, hey, you know, I’ve never

used Moringa before.

What are the things to look out for?

How do I, you know, source this appropriately and use it so I experience benefits?

And that benefits thing is, I guess, the third piece that I’ll mention.

So the book is meant to be a bridge between, you know, all the information out there and

that middle ground.

That’s what we say.

It’s definitive, but it’s also this really accessible guide trying to cover both grounds

there.

But the benefit piece was also what really drove me and motivated me through the process

of writing because with the hype and with kind of the explosion of adaptogens in the

marketplace, there’s a lot of mislabeling.

There’s a lot of people buying adaptogens in the wrong amounts or the wrong forms.

This is like a huge problem in the functional mushroom arena.

And so people would come to me, especially in private practice and, you know, through

college, full of clinical herbalism, where I teach my young aspiring herbalist and

they’re like, yeah, I tried that or someone else tried it and one of my clients have tried

It didn’t work.

I’m like, all right.

Let’s dig into that.

Why didn’t it work?

You know, were you actually buying what you thought you were buying?

Were you getting the right amount?

Was it extracted properly?

Was it coming from the right country of origin and all of these things to ensure that essentially

the supplements were buying are viable?

And I like to remind us like the most expensive supplements we buy are the ones that don’t

And so how do we avoid that happening?

One to save us time and money and resources, but also to help maintain the reputation

and the value of these incredible ingredients because it just breaks my heart when people

are like, yeah, I tried Chaga and I didn’t do anything.

You know, I don’t believe in that.

Michael, let’s make sure you are getting what you wanted to get because these are incredible.

But there’s certain things that you’ve got to check off the list to make sure that you

can actually reap what these are capable of offering us.

It’s really interesting in that point about trying something in it, not necessarily working

right away.

Obviously, it can be caused by a number of different factors as you just elucidated.

This reminds me of a conversation I was having with my mom just yesterday where she’ll

often recommend she does a daily golden milk with turmeric and it’s a huge, a huge game

changer for her and she’ll often recommend this to some of her other friends and colleagues

in that older age bracket and it struck it off the air to really address and reset

and to have the right conditions for those benefits to be sustained on a going forward

basis.

And so, yeah, I imagine not only is this a matter of quality and dosing but also giving

the supplements and our bodies enough time to have those changes kind of take hold,

I mean, I like to say adaptions are an appeal for an L. Same with many of our herbal

medicines, right?

You’ve got to be consistent and know that you’re going to do something for several weeks

or several months to experience the outcomes, you know, for years to come and we’re in

a society where we’re kind of obsessed with like short-term wins and so how do we, is

this balance?

You have to make sure something works but also something working might not mean you feel

it in 15 minutes.

With some of these adaptions, that’s actually the case, like cordicets is an awesome example

if people like don’t believe in the benefits of them, all right, try this high potency cordicets

fruiting body extracts 1,500 milligrams, like let’s see, you’ll feel it.

But predominantly, as a group, you’ve got to be patient and know that they’re much more

subtle and they replenishing a lot of nutrients in our body that have been depleted and we’ve

been chronically depleted in, I think, the first and foremost because of how stressed we

You know, stress takes a huge toll on our body, not only energetically, right?

Of course, you know, resources are reallocated to like the survival mechanisms of our body,

but on a physiological level as well, being stressed pulls nutrients from our bodies.

Like, we use a lot more vitamin C when we’re stressed, we’re running through our reservoirs,

our banks of resources and what’s so unique about these 21 adaptions is there’s some

of the most nutrient dense foods that we have on the planet.

So I really look at them like we’re punishing and restoring these reservoirs in our systems

so that when the stress commas, which is inevitable, we are like watering our roots, you know,

we’re really, we’re fertilizing our roots so that we have this strong foundation to draw

from so that when the stressors do occur, you know, which are, which are always going

to happen, we’re not so far pushed off of our center, which then takes, you know, many

weeks of not months to to get back to a state of equilibrium, we can become more resilient,

we can move them like thinking of Tai Chi, you know, we can like shift and move and still be

in a place of balance because we’ve done this long term healing work, you know, we’ve,

we’ve been drinking, been drinking the herbs or the mushrooms for days for weeks and we have

that foundation. Well, yeah, it’s interesting and one of the things that jump right out at me

with the book is the way that you’ve organized the information and the, uh, really, uh,

recommendations according to three major categories, defend, perform and restore. And I should,

I should note this, this is, uh, non-tended to diagnose, treat or cure any illnesses, right?

And we got to put out all the disclaimers here as we’re having this conversation and I may even

put a little language in the show notes, but, um, nonetheless, you’ve, you’ve organized the 21

adaptogens according to these three major categories of defend, perform and restore. And so,

could you just walk us through what each of those means and, uh, help us kind of develop that

same framework that you’ve got in your book? Yeah, let’s think about it in terms of stress,

which I think they’re like simple like, there’s, uh, before the stress occurs, it’s like, how can

we prepare ourselves? This is another word for defend, uh, to prepare ourselves before the,

the inevitable thing comes our way. So, let’s do that pre-work. It’s almost the, um,

there’s this really quirky thing that my friend, Danika, says, she’s like, let’s, uh, pre-charge so

we don’t have to recharge. So, the defend adaptions can be thought about in that way. It’s pre-charge

and a lot of them focus on immunity gut health, which of course are interrelatable, 70% of our

immunity lives within our gut. So, really that’s the sound age in. And then of course,

skin beauty is part of that as well, which when we think of it internally is really related to our

detoxification systems and our, um, our liver health. So, I think of those as kind of the foundations,

how can we set ourselves up to have, uh, really strong gut health immunity, liver, um,

processes working actively. And then from there, you know, okay, a stressor does perform,

or a stressor does occur. The next brings us to report, which is how do we, how do we show up

acutely in the face of these stressors? And so, I’ve kind of broken this into two categories where

we have like brain and body. So, a lot of times, you know, we have to stare at a computer all day,

even if we’re being, we’re really stressed and being yelled at all day or whatever the

programming is coming at us in some direction. Uh, so these more neutropic cognitive supporting

adaptogens or the physical energy and endurance adaptogens. So, um, when the stress comes and we are

wanting to be totally bedded out and depleted, how do we actually give our bodies the resources

to show up and have the energy we need to combat that acute physical stress? And then of course,

just like in a exercise regimen, this third phase is the, the restore. So, once that stressor

has passed, how do we support our systems to replenish? And this is really actually where I

recommend most people start, because a lot of us have already been through all these stressors

and we’re needing to really begin in this restoration phase. These are also our most gentle adaptogens.

They’re really targeting, well, all of them target stress. These are particularly helpful at

the stress, the mood benefits, as well as sleep, which is, which is so relevant. And, you know,

it kind of, some of them more general well-being, those that don’t have this one specific benefit,

which none of them do. They’re adaptogens. That’s what makes them adaptogens is they’re

non-specific by nature. And yet, I think another thing that’s relevant here when categorizing

is always trying to meet people where they’re at. So, well, you know, let’s say I talk about

Chaga in the defend category because of its antioxidant profile, amazing for skin health and

immunity and digestion. And yet, it does so many other things as well. And that’s part of the

beauty and the magic of these ingredients. But this categorization, this like three tiered system

is a way to gently start to think about them either in, you know, by different times of day,

or to support the cycles of stress. But take it loosely, you know, I think continue to be

open-minded and potentially even like, expect surprises when you start using adaptogens.

Right. It’s not like, okay, I’m going to take this cortisapse adaption because I need that

immediate performance and I need that quick energy today. Well, you might also notice that,

you know, you don’t get sick whenever an else in your community gets sick in a few weeks or

maybe your stress response has been reduced and you’re sleeping better, right? There’s these

secondary benefits that come from all of them. So, the categorization is loose. It’s like not

hard doors boxing them in, but more of a way to start to think about them in different segments

based on supporting the phases of stress. Yeah, that’s great. And one of the other attributes

that you discuss for many of these adaptogens is effects on the libido, which of course might be

of interest to some of our audience. And I’m curious, does that fall into the defend

performer’s store categories neatly or is that just sort of another dimension of

attribute or effect that you’re seeing with these 21 adaptogens?

Yeah, great questions. So, when we think about how stress is taking a toll on our body,

libido is our libido is often suppressed when we’re in a state of stress, along with many other

systems in our body. Like when an acute stressor occurs, we have to think about how we evolutionarily

evolve to respond to the stressor. And in that moment, when a, you know,

saber-shoothed tiger is coming to attack us, the body concentrates its energy into

immediate survival needs, right? So, your body’s not telling you when you’re either going to

fight that tiger or run for your life, it’s not going to tell you whether you’re hungry or thirsty

or tired or horny, right? All of these things that are fundamental to being a human being,

but not necessary for that acute state of survival. And so, resources, you know, we only have so

many resources, those are pooled. And what has happened today is although it’s not a tiger coming

to attack us, our body responds in a similar way. And it’s not only once, every couple of months,

it’s actually often, once an hour, you know, it’s not more often. And so, when people, especially

in private practice come to me and they’re like, hey, you know, my sex drive is really low,

I have no libido. And I start talking to them about their stress. They’re like,

they almost get frustrated. They’re like, why are you talking about my stress? I want to talk

about my libido. Like, give me a quick fix. But if we want that long-term rejuvenation, that vitality

back into the body, right, to have oxygen in the bloodstream and to circulate blood appropriately,

and to have those feelings, like, we need to make sure that the stressor is removed. I give

the metaphor in the book, like, if someone is pushing on a certain part of your body,

that’s the only thing you’re going to think about. And that’s where all your attention goes,

and when that pin or that pressure point gets removed, the energy can start flowing into the

rest of the body again. And so, this is the approach with adaptogens in libido. Although, some are

more directly, you know, have this direct tie, things like mocha and cordiceps. But in general,

when we support our stress response, and we remove, it’s like a river, and we remove these

blockages, the body can start to move energy in all of these other systems in the organs of the body.

And, oops, where’d you go? And the libido can come back naturally for the long-term, right? Not just

not just to take a quick pill that might help you for that moment, but actually, you know,

a healthy libido for weeks and years.

Yeah, that’s so wonderful, you know, and I’m actually right now. I’m enjoying a beverage,

and this is not an IPA, although it looks like it could be a seem to be one. This is actually one

of the four sigmatic products, a defend plant-based protein shake with a variety of mushrooms and

adaptogens, vanilla flavor, and it’s delicious. So, I just want to bring that into the discussion,

and when I wrote the book YonEarth a number of years ago, I wrote a chapter called

Change, which is about our opportunities for changing, changing our own habits, changing our

own health and well-being, and our personalized well-also working for positive change in our

communities and in our broader world. And in that discussion, there’s this notion of

picking up and putting down, right? Like, as we’re picking up better habits for ourselves, often

that also means we need to and or have an opportunity to put down some of the other habits that

perhaps aren’t serving us as well. And I’ll take this opportunity to mention that for me,

one of the things that had to happen over the last several years was no longer drinking alcohol,

and I noticed, you know, right in the introduction of the book here, and I’m going to quote you,

there’s something, speaking right to this, it says the most common unifying experience in modern

life is stress, and it’s taking a serious toll on our health. To cope, it’s easy to rely on hyper-palitable

food, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals, yet we are not getting better. And more over the tools we

are using to cope are keeping our mental and physical energy low, prohibiting us from sleeping

well and causing us to perform at only the level of merely scraping by. And we’re going to go

through each of the 21 adaptogens in super brief form here so that the audience can get a sense

in a flavor, a taste, so to speak, of each of them. But before we get into those, I just want to

speak for a moment about these other things that so many of us are turning to and are perhaps

an unhealthy balance or relationship within our lives. Like I was with alcohol a number of years ago,

and I’m curious, when you’re speaking with folks, whether it’s in a formal setting or not,

how often does it come up before or while you’re also recommending certain adaptogens that folks

are, you know, taking a good look at some of the other things they might do less of?

It’s an integral part of the conversation. Adaptions are not a magic pill. They’re

pretty close, you know, for to stick a plan, you’re like, what’s the most phytocomal complex and

something that’s really going to support us in a short and long term, but they’re not a

magic pill. None of this is a magic pill. And so we have to look at the other practices and

the other things we’re doing in our lifestyle. I mean, first and foremost is what are we nourishing

ourselves with? And that’s in the form of liquids and in food. And if you’re eating a really unhealthy

diet and drinking a bunch of alcohol or having processed foods every day, the adaptions,

yeah, might help a little bit, but the kind of compounding benefits that you have when we start

to look at our health holistically is so much greater. And so I just did a series. I did like a live

radio show with this host and we did on air as his herbalist. I’m like, okay, we’re going to walk

through this and he was so excited to see it just read the book and he’s like, it won all these

adaptogens. And they didn’t offer him adaptogens in that full first session until like a couple

weeks in. And it was like really looking at exercise and the water he was drinking and what’s

what sorts of foods were nourishing him. And these other aspects to what what makes us

human and the practices that were involved with. And so yeah, we have to bring them on board.

And I don’t blame anyone, you know, first and foremost. It’s like we do have to meet ourselves

where we’re at. So when we have these crazy demands being parents or working multiple jobs or

even working a job and being a parent or being a spouse or having farm work or having an herbal

practice, you know, we’re juggling a lot. Like we’re all doing many, many things. We were talking

earlier. I don’t know if we just have more energy or if we know the world needs these skills,

but there’s a lot on all of our plates. And it can be overwhelming and exhausting. And so I don’t

blame, you know, anyone for saying like, okay, I just need a glass of wine or I just need whatever

this thing is that they’re turning to, but I encourage. And we know what I’m trying to do with

with this book and conversations like this is like, what if there’s another way? Because right now,

we don’t really, we’re not told there’s other ways. We’re just like, this is the most available

thing or this is the easiest thing or the quickest fix. But what if there’s another way that actually

got you to where you want it to be temporarily and could help you get and achieve your goals

more easily, you know, next month or next year. And so just at least trying on that possibility

is really exciting. It’s like, wait, what do you mean? There’s another way to unwind besides

alcohol. It’s like, yeah, we’re seeing this amazing rise of like non-alcoholic beverages with

herbs. It’s the same thing. I think of when people in my practice would come to me and they’re like,

yeah, I’m using cannabis for digestion or headaches or sleep. And I’m like, what if I told you

there was at least a dozen other herbs that would maybe do the same thing, but be more relevant

for your specific body and symptoms. I’m like, what do you mean? The weed isn’t the only way.

And I’m like, no, let’s create this squalcat passion flower hops beautiful combination tea for

sleep. And then when you wake up, we can add these adaptions. There’s so many other ways that

we’re just, they’re not really available to us in the same way as the quick fixes. And so,

yeah, it’s really about slowly, slowly breaking that cycle. And it’s almost like humor as how

easy it becomes when you take that first mental step to like, okay, I’m going to try something

else. I’m going to change something. It’s like, I always recommend adding before subtracting.

So rather than like looking at your whole life and like, oh my god, I got to cut out alcohol and

dairy and gluten and I have to get off all my medication. Like, no, no, no, that’s not what it is.

Let’s start thinking of what healthy habit can you add, you know, and really build into your daily

life. Maybe that’s, you know, a timeout. Maybe that’s breathing for a minute without a screen.

Maybe that’s adding a case of blueberries into your week every week. Maybe it’s putting some

trace minerals in your water. It’s simple things and you motivate yourself, you know, these little

things we start feeling like even 2% better and it gives us the confidence to do the next thing and

the next thing. And adaptions I find are an easy first thing to do, especially if it’s stacked onto

a habit that you already do. So this is, you know, what we do with ForSigmatic, we look at, okay,

what routines do people already have every day? What are they doing that they’re not getting rid of,

you know, drinking coffee, having a protein smoothie and we add these really potent adaption

extracts into these daily habits so that without even really doing anything different, you start

to feel those benefits subtly and it’s that little shift that encourages you to do the next thing

and the next thing. And like all of that accumulates and adds up and it’s exciting, you know,

before you know, you’re like, wait, and what did I even do? But my body’s not really craving that

that wine anymore or I don’t really want that like really sugary treat. It doesn’t sound great,

you know, I know that it’s going to make me feel like crap in an hour. So yeah, I guess all

that to say, you know, holistic looking at all parts of your life, your diet is so, so relevant

and meeting yourself where you’re at, adding before subtracting and just starting slow and knowing

that like every little percent of change is building to that future of a life really full of

vitality that I think all of us are searching for. Absolutely. Yeah, it’s wonderful. You know,

one of the ways I like thinking about how some of these craving responses show up is that,

you know, a lot of this, as you know, comes from our gut microbiota, biome, and we’re literally each one of us, every single one of us is a farmer, whether

we know it or not, and we are farming this huge colony of a variety of microorganisms in

our digestive system.

And when we’re growing the ones say that really like sugar because we’re eating a lot of sugar,

well, they’re going to send signals to have us crave more sugar, possibly several times

a day, right?

And as we make those switches, that population will actually decrease in number.

And so they won’t be putting out those signals quite as strongly, and eventually those signals

won’t show up at all anymore.

And so yeah, it’s fun to think about it, right?

Like we’re farming our own colony of billions and trillions of organisms.

I love that metaphor.

I’ve never thought of it in that way, but it’s so true.

And with every bite of food, we can think, who am I feeding?

Because we have all of these bacteria.

We have fungi.

I mean, we have more different organisms within our microbiome than we do human cells in our

body, right?

We are made of what’s happening in our gut.

Now we’re realizing our mood is dependent on our gut health and our immunity and all

of these other parts of being a human.

And so we can say, yeah, who do I want to feed more of?

And it reminds me of like in psychology, different thought patterns, where my fiancee

works in mental health and as a physician.

So in like the Western sense of the word, but he, we talk about, you know, what thoughts

are you, are you feeding and what thoughts are you exercising?

And really the more we think about something, the more those neural pathways are connected

and stronger.

And when we divert our attention or start thinking about something else, those neural

pathways get stronger.

Same thing in our gut, right?

Like who are we feeding?

Good guys, bad guys.

And that can be so empowering too, like, oh, it’s all, well, there’s all these different

connections that get sent in.

But it’s like our dollar too.

I think about this all the time, like, how can I make a difference environmentally?

And I’m like, you vote with your dollar every single day.

That is your investment in the future of that farmer or in the future of the Walmart

or whoever it is you’re investing in, you are saying here, I support what you’re doing

and I believe in your future.

Here’s my dollar, right?

And so same thing with our gut, okay, I want more of you to thrive, okay, so I’m going

to feed those that crave sugar or I’m going to feed those that crave kale, right?

And how powerful to kind of distill it to that simple of like, yeah, what am I feeding?

Looking at our plate.

Absolutely, yeah, I’d love that you mentioned the power we have with our purchasing decisions

and in why on earth there’s actually a chapter called demand that speaks to this, I call

it a Jedi superpower, each one of us is wielding every day where we’re putting hundreds

of signals into the marketplace every day.

When we go to order a single meal out of restaurant, for example, that meal is comprised

of dozens of ingredients, right?

And so depending on the type of restaurant we’re choosing to dine at, those are all signals

going to the marketplace and of course the foods that we choose to purchase to consume

at home.

Same thing.

It’s really, really powerful, it’s absolutely shaping not only the economic landscape

and who’s thriving financially and who isn’t, but that is a major feedback into our political

landscape as we, I think, know.

So there are all of these systemic relationships in the macro, kind of political economy world

with these specific choices reach making every day, that in a way mirrors, I think a lot

of the complex interconnectivity we find within our own bodies when we’re looking at these

systems and understanding these interrelationships.

Totally.

Love these, yeah, mirrors, what’s happening inside, what’s happening outside and yeah, it’s

exciting, it empowers us to think about it in this way.

Yeah, absolutely.

And I wanted to pick up on this thread of water.

You mentioned it, you know, we can add more trace minerals in our water.

And I find that, you know, probably there’s a whole lot of us who simply ought to drink

more water than we’re currently drinking in any given day.

And that’s really important to consider.

And I think that there’s a major question right now around water quality, what’s in the

water, what’s imprinted in the water.

And I’m really curious what you tell folks when they’re asking about water, where to

get water, how to work with water, depending on the sources available to them.

So, so, so, so important in conversation.

Yeah, it’s not even about drinking more water, it’s how do we drink better water, you

know, it’s like more is better, better is better.

And water is so water is life, right, this is vital to to every cell in our body.

And so often, especially in higher elevation zones, you know, you’re in Colorado, people

are, are dehydrated.

But a lot of us are just dehydrated and that’s, you know, and we think about inflammation,

which is at the root of so many diseases, especially the most common diseases people

are dealing with.

It’s an internal state of heat, right, we think of inflammation, it’s hot and it’s dry.

And so how do we replenish ourselves with water, but what what I found is a lot of people

are drinking, drinking, drinking water, and they’re not actually hydrating themselves.

Why is this?

Our water is void of the minerals, the trace minerals that were always involved, that were

always a part of water when we would drink spring water.

And not to get too political or conspiracy, but our springs have been purchased by big

companies.

And so we don’t, many of us don’t drink spring water.

Instead, we’re drinking water that’s coming out of our tap.

And what happens with that water, especially in this country, is it’s been treated, right,

to kill different pathogens and bacteria in the water.

And I think of that almost like, our water is getting a dose of antibiotics, you know,

it’s like, okay, we got to kill all the bad guys.

And in response, that’s exactly what it’s doing, so it’s clean.

And yet, it’s killing all the microbiome in our body as well.

And it’s void of the minerals that we need.

So yeah, essentially, you know, filtering our water is so important, but what happens,

you know, I have a burky filter I’m looking at, which has these great, great option charcoal

filters and then a fluoride filter.

But then what happens is we’re left with what I call empty water, you know, so it’s so

clean, it’s been stripped of minerals.

And so we could drink, drink, drink, but we’re not actually, you know, we need the salts

and the other minerals for our cells to actually utilize the water.

So there’s a couple options, you know, if you’re totally, you know, you have a classic filter.

I often tell people to start with adding some lemon and like a high quality Himalayan salt

to their water.

What I put in the bottom of my burky system are a type of rock, they’re called miphon stones.

And they’re really porous and they actually leach a lot of minerals from the stone back

into the water.

You can get really heavy and I put a bunch of crystals in there as well, you know, in

re-program the water.

So that’s a great option.

There’s an amazing company called Trace Minerals that you can actually drop, they get their

trace minerals from Utah and it’s this concentrate of many of the minerals that are, should be

in our water that are devoid of it today and you can drop that into your filtered water

afterwards.

Or if you can have access to spring water, you know, there’s a great website called

Find a Spring and you can try to find springs near you.

Of course, be careful, know what’s around, if so many environmental issues to be aware

of who’s dumping things into the, into the ground and who’s upstream.

But yeah, there’s so much healing that can happen if we just shift the water that we’re

drinking by, you know, really starting to re-mineralize, I think is the biggest thing

that people aren’t talking about.

Yeah, it’s so important.

Yeah, by the way, I think sometime in the near term, we’re going to have a podcast interview

with my friend Pratchett, Pratchett Gressgoan, who has a water mineral company sourcing some

very special minerals from different volcanic sources around the world.

And so that’ll, that’ll be of great interest, I think.

Yeah, I mean, our food used to have so many of these minerals as well.

I talk about this a bit in healing adaptogens, but it’s like, not only are we so stressed

and more stressed than ever before, the tools that we have to deal with that, that stress

are less, you know, the foods that we’re eating.

They don’t contain the minerals, the vitamins, the, the phyto compounds that we need.

And of course, all of these used to be so present in our soil.

And now because of monocultures and pesticides and herbicides, all the sides and what

we’ve done to our agricultural system, even foods that used to be rich in these key minerals,

they’re not rich in them anymore because they’re not present in our soil.

And so, yeah, replenishing through our waters is profound, truly.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely, that’s so important.
