Hi friends, welcome to the YonEarth Communities Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast

series.

Today we have such an exciting program for you.

I am here with my friend Adam Stenfinegal.

Hey Adam.

How are you doing?

Great.

Thanks for having me.

You bet.

Devoted the bulk of his professional career to helping stop runaway climate change,

specifically working with changes we can make in our own homes to reduce our carbon

footprints to reduce and eliminate our use of fossil fuels.

And Adam has co-founded several companies working on these efforts, including sustainably

built, snug home, snug pro.

And today we’re going to be talking about the work he’s doing with his colleagues and

partners at FuelSwitch.

And Adam, it’s such a pleasure to be with you today and I’m excited to have this conversation

with you.

Thanks me too.

So Adam, I want to ask you before we dive into some of the technical discussion and some

of the opportunities that we all have in our own homes, I just want to ask you, how did

you get into this work?

What drew you in this direction?

Well, long stories.

I’ll try to keep it somewhat concise.

But I’ve always known that I needed to be doing something good for the world throughout

my whole life.

And early on I ended up getting involved in political activism, just generally as an

activist and did a lot of work in the protest movement, but from a media perspective.

So we did a lot of media coverage and helped work on these media centers.

And we cropped Trump all over the world and we’d discover all kinds of struggle in social

justice, to environmental racism, so many different components of things that are going

on in genocide and, man, holy crap, there’s a lot of things that are really bad in the

world.

And so that was always an important piece that I was paying attention to.

But eventually, really decided that it’s great to be raising hell and screaming and

yelling.

And that’s really important.

But I just needed to see the change in my eyes, right?

And we’d actually be sure that I was doing something that affected change.

So I heard from my uncle, was really awesome, it was an inter-design firm in Chicago and

they do a lot of this green building stuff.

And he told me about this report from Edward Masria, this really architected these really

cool studies many years ago about the building industry and what its impact was on climate.

And they did this study that says that 48% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United

States came from the building industry.

I’m like, wow, there’s one big thing that’s physical, that we can change, that I can

see the change on, I’m going to get involved in green building.

And so that took me down this huge path of all different kinds of circumstances that

came together and eventually started founding some businesses around that and went from

So wonderful, wonderful.

So one of the things I love about the work you’re doing and the state of the world at

this very moment is that, yes, on the one hand, we have incredible challenges.

We are confronted by some of the most complex challenges we’ve ever faced as a species.

However, on the other hand, we have the tools and the expertise needed to resolve a lot

of these systemic challenges that we’re facing and with fuel switch, this is very much

at the core of what you guys are doing.

Can you just tell us a bit about the work you’re doing with fuel switch?

So, the primary premise is that buildings, as I just said, use a ton of energy and have

a big carbon impact.

And that’s from the materials that we use to create the buildings, but mostly in the

energy that they consume over the course of their lifetime.

When you build a building, the idea is that building will last a hundred years.

So everything that you do when you do any kind of changes or especially new construction,

it’s likely going to be around for a hundred years.

And so that’s why it’s such a big impact in an important place to focus on.

So what we do with fuel switch is we come into the old homes.

We focus on existing homes and help those homes come up to these standards, modern day

building codes and things like that, but also go all the way to net zero.

So net zero, what is net zero?

So net zero energy means that the building will produce as much energy on site as it

consumes over the course of a year through renewables.

So the key components of that are one to use less energy, so energy efficiency.

So we insulate the walls, we insulate the attic, we’ll condition your crawl space or

do all the different kinds of insulation and air sealing in the house.

So that’s the number one piece and that brings the need for heat and the need for cooling

way low.

It uses that mean for energy dramatically.

The second thing we do is we eliminate the natural gas in your house because natural

gas is a fossil fuel as much as they say.

It’s a clean fuel.

It’s not.

The only way of arguments that we can give is to why we need to get rid of natural gas

from being burned in our homes.

And it’s a fossil fuel and that means we’re producing carbon dioxide and that is causing

climate change.

So we’ve got to stop burning all fossil fuels.

So natural gas, we get rid of it.

Most people heat their homes through their spacing, the furnaces, the boilers, et cetera

with natural gas as well as their water heat.

We transform all of that.

We take out that equipment and we replace it with air source heat pumps for sometimes

geothermal.

And these systems now produce all that heat and you get the added benefit of cooling

in a place like Colorado where most people didn’t have cooling before.

Now we need it.

Thanks to climate change.

So it’s one of those things.

We can kill a lot of birds with one stone there.

So we’re electrifying, we’re insulating.

We’re then taking another big step and helping people get into electric vehicles.

Because that’s another massive energy use outside of that building industry space.

But the effects of that are huge.

And the economics around electric vehicles are really amazing, especially if you can

then power them with rooftop solar.

So that’s the fourth piece of our puzzle as we put enough solar on the roof to cover

all of those needs to cover the air source heat pumps, to cover your plug loads, to cover

all the electrical requirements.

It does your space heating, it does your water heating, and it does your cooling.

And that roof that solar system powers all of it.

Beautiful.

So at the course of the entire year your utility bill is ideally zero.

So the four main elements of this sort of transformation and fuel switch would be to

reduce the load with the wrapping, the insulation, the ceiling to switch out basically your

appliances that are dealing with heating and cooling of air and water and so forth.

The PV, or excuse me, the rooftop PV, the electric generation, utilizing this incredibly

wonderful nuclear generator, we all have access to, called the Sun, right, 163,000 terawatts

of energy continually streaming onto our planet since the beginning of the human race and

long before that, there’s such an abundance of energy we can all be harvesting.

And so that harvesting with rooftop solar is a third and then the fourth.

Is that the electric vehicle?

Is that the fourth in the puzzle?

Wonderful.

And I was struck by this graphic that I know you guys have on your Facebook page, which

is fuel switch on the Facebook app.

And on here there’s a graphic, we’ll show it in our show notes.

But I am so struck that when we’re talking about things we can do at the individual

and household level, some of the standards that we grew up with like recycling are yes

important to do, but ultimately have really minuscule impact compared to the impact we

can have when we do the fuel switch that you’re describing.

And getting into electrical vehicles is another one that is potent and one of the things

I’m struck by as I still own and drive a fossil fuel, combusting vehicle, is that not

only am I continually paying for the fuel, but also for all of the fluids and lubricants

that are needed in that more complex and we could say less efficient in a sense more

primitive way of delivering power to the four wheels.

And boy, that gives expensive at times as well just that ongoing maintenance of that internal

combustion engine.

Yeah, and my favorite data point on that is an internal combustion engine has something

like 2,000 moving parts, an electric vehicle has 20.

So imagine the amount of maintenance and the costs that it is to maintain that gasoline

car, the internal combustion engine, it’s a totally different world with electric vehicles

and they’re really cool.

Yeah, it’s happening.

I love it.

Well, and I’m really excited that today we’re here in the home of Steve and Price, one

of your clients and friends and what we’re going to be able to do is take a tour with your

colleague Clay Doosel and look at some of the different components and technologies and

techniques that you guys have incorporated in this home, in this remodel project.

So hang tight will be getting to that tour that’s going to be a lot of fun.

And I think before we go there, one of the things I want to circle back on Adam is the

element of the indoor air quality as it relates to these issues and these opportunities.

Because I think one of the things that I know a lot of my friends and family may not realize

is that this actually making this fuel switch delivers incredible benefits that go actually

even beyond reducing our carbon footprint as it relates to climate change.

And some of these additional benefits are extraordinarily important in terms of our own

health and well being that of our kids and our pets and so forth.

So can you just tell us a little more about that?

Yeah, absolutely.

So we’ll come back to the economic side of things because that’s another, that’s kind

of icing on the cake as I like to put it.

But the indoor air quality is a huge piece that I learned many years ago in the green building

space.

The materials that we use in our home, off gas and put all kinds of toxic pollutants into

the air.

If you’re in an older home and existing home, we haven’t done much of that in a while.

It’s not as big a deal because you’ve already inhaled all that and it’s already, you know,

off gas, right?

But so there’s lots of things that we can do around that.

However, one of the big, big pieces that causes indoor air quality problems is cooking

with the gas cooktop.

And you know, people are like, oh, but I love my gas cooktop, the greatest things ever.

And I’m like, that’s fine.

It feels switch.

We don’t make you get rid of your gas cooktop.

Although it is really cool to cap a gas line and say, by buy utility, I don’t need gas

anymore.

We’re out of here.

So we’ve got plenty of customers who’ve done that.

But, but folks can keep their natural gas ranges if they do.

However, I’m going to give you a data point that’s really fascinating and Clay can talk

about this in a little bit.

He’s going to do this tour.

But Clay put in a food box.

We’ve got this, it’s an indoor air quality monitor.

What the heck is a food box?

It’s this little box that’s in your mantle of your house or whatever, just put it out

in the middle of your house.

And it hooks up to your cell phone and it tells you what the quality of your air is and

measures all different kinds of pollutants that are bad for your health.

And Clay can be sitting in his office looking at this phone and he can know when his kids

or his wife goes and puts on the tea kettle on the gas stove.

And immediately, just turning on that gas stove enough to boil some water, takes the indoor

air quality of his house above EPA’s recommended levels for health.

That’s just good.

A sounding tea, right?

So we know that burning natural gas is just not a good thing.

We don’t need it.

There’s incredible technologies like Stephen has here.

We’ll show that when the tour in a minute, an induction cooktop.

This thing can boil a kettle of the huge kettle of water in two minutes.

Oh my God.

It’s so powerful and it’s very detailed control.

Most people who love to cook, when they use an induction cooktop, they’ll never go back

to gas.

So it’s just a neat feature and you get all these benefits of indoor air quality.

So we’re not at all talking about the old electric resistive coils that some of us

maybe remember growing up or what have you.

We’re talking about something that is the cutting edge really provides as much or greater

control as gas when we’re preparing meals for friends and loved ones and all that.

Absolutely.

That’s great.

I think with the indoor air quality thing, it’s particularly important as we know a lot

of research is showing that increased rates of childhood asthma and other respiratory

and health issues related to pollutants in our indoor air, the air in our homes, the

air in our offices, daycares and so on, is really impacting society in a big way.

And my gosh, this opportunity to kind of clean it up at home is really what a powerful

statement that becomes in terms of what we’re valuing as people.

That’s right.

And we don’t have to burn fossil fuels, you know.

It was a great invention.

It helped our economy.

It helped us grow.

It helped us do really neat things in society, but now we know the consequences and it’s

time to switch because we don’t need it.

It’s time to switch, indeed.

Well, I just want to mention a couple things, Adam, for our audience.

One is if you’re in the Metro Denver area, the front range of Colorado, fuel switch is providing

services ranging from the beginning energy audits of your home all the way through to the

design, looking at the financial modeling and helping with the installation of all these

different technologies and tools.

And for folks who would like to engage with fuel switch to get your initial energy audit

done, you can mention the Y Honors community podcast and get a $50 discount on that initial

energy audit.

And that’s a wonderful value.

Thank you for sharing that with us.

So outside of the Metro Denver area, we know that fuel switch is looking for additional

partners, contractors and others who do this kind of work in other communities.

And for folks who would like to engage with Adam and Clay on that front, hello at gofuelswitch.com

is a great way to connect in.

Again, I want to mention that on Facebook, you’ve got fuel switch, easy to find there.

There’s some great graphics there.

And I would like to mention as well that for any of you out there who would like to check

out any of our electronic or audiobook products at Y on Earth, use the code podcast to get

a discount on those as well.

So I just, I want to circle back Adam to the context.

Here we are.

Our world is changing.

The climate is destabilizing and that’s not a debate.

That’s happening.

We face incredible challenges with that reality.

And there are so many things right at our fingertips we can be doing in our own homes,

in our communities.

I want to ask you how, how does it feel when you’re waking up every day, getting

ready to work, and you know that A, on the one hand, you have so much to offer folks

to help mitigate these challenges that we’re facing.

And on the other hand, these are big, big, big challenges.

What’s that like for you?

It’s daunting, right?

Not for sure, but it is the reason I wake up every morning.

It is my purpose.

So all the businesses that I’m involved in, we’re really working hard to save carbon in

everything that we do.

And some of the businesses we can actually track the savings and we can tally up the numbers.

And it’s really fun to be like, wow, this business just saved 500,000 metric tons of carbon

through what we were doing.

So those types of things are like, okay, take a deep breath.

You know, Trump might screw up this country and by taking this out of the Paris Accords

and the entire world by doing this, but what’s really amazing is that people are stepping

So a great example of that is through the US Sustainability Directors Network.

This, you know, when Trump said, we’re out of the Paris Climate Accords, we don’t care

about climate, a group of cities representing 40% of the nation’s population stepped up

and said, we’re going to do the Paris Climate Accords, and we’re going to pre-desivate,

and we’re going to meet those goals.

So we can do this.

So government governments are ready, the people want it.

There’s another study that I just read from Vox just recently that was really fascinating

about what do consumers want, and it was about the utility industry and how to do consumers

care about renewable energy, 75% of US utility bill payers said that they want their electricity

to be 100% renewable.

51% of those people said they would gladly pay a 30% premium to get it.

That’s big.

Things are changing.

People want this stuff.

They get it.

We know it.

And regardless of what our federal government is doing, the cities, the states, and the utilities

are starting to step up and say, okay, we can do this.

This is so powerful.

You know, it strikes me that if you look around in the media currently, there’s not that

You’re going to find 75% of Americans agreeing on apparently.

And we have so many friends in the Green Faith community, for example, who have a variety

of different political persuasions, but this very issue is galvanizing us throughout society.

And to me, it’s one of the greatest sources of hope being out there in various communities

seeing that people from a variety of backgrounds and walks are engaged in this issue and engaging

in what can be done.

And I think that with a resource like what you guys are providing through fuel switch,

it just puts so many more tools in the tool chest of us, folks, and communities all over.

And I’m so excited to be able to share this with our audience and really encourage the

audience to check out fuel switch, get involved, get engaged, get that energy audit done for

your home, and it’s amazing how much change we can make so quickly with these approaches.

That’s right.

So we’re probably about ready to do a tour, Adam.

Is there anything before we get to kind of look around the house here that you want

to make sure to mention?

I think that’s really it.

It’s going to be fun to walk through Steven’s house and see a lot of the different pieces

that we’ve put together here.

There’s lots of new technology that’s out there.

This isn’t your father’s house, mobile anymore.

The reason we’re able to do fuel switching on existing homes and make it cost effective

today with today’s technologies is because of all this new stuff that’s come out in recent

days, as well as the incredibly regularly decreasing price of solar.

Right.

Amazing.

So we’re dropping the prices and so all of this is now well affordable for all of us.

One of the things that I discovered doing research when I was writing Why on Earth is that

our fossil energy prices generally are bouncing along a band of price ranges that behave like

commodities.

They are commodities, right?

Meanwhile, our renewable energy technologies which are harvesting a virtually limitless

source of energy from the sun are following a very different price behavior, a price curve

similar to Moore’s law as it relates to computing technology.

We know that with computing technology, for example, we get to double the capacity and

speed of processors at half the price every 18 months or so.

That’s been the experience over several decades.

There’s a very similar pricing dynamic occurring with solar in particular now in well over

30 states in the United States.

For example, it is cheaper to install, this is at utility scale, to install renewable generating

capacity than it is to install the fossil generating capacity.

This is just to me another example of what an amazingly hopeful moment we’re in right

now and not that dynamic really just kicked in in the last couple of years.

We face these big challenges, but we actually have so many solutions right at our fingertips.

Should we give folks a tour?

All right.

Sounds good.

Friends, if you’re listening to the podcast, maybe you’re driving in your electric vehicle

or in the comfort of your renewable powered home, we’re going to now switch and go on

a tour here of Steven’s home.

And so just want to invite you that if you’re engaging right now through audio and you would

like to check out the tour, you can go to yonder.org, the podcast page, and get to the video

portion of this and join us in this tour today.

Friends, so we’re getting ready now to go on the tour of Steven Price’s home.

And Clay Ducel is going to lead us through this tour.

Clay, you were the brains behind a lot of the renovations and retrofits that were done

here in Steven’s home.

Tell us just what that framework is and how you kind of approached working with Steven

on this project.

Well, that’s great.

Thanks.

You know, we had a neat opportunity here.

Steven bought a house that was in bad need of a full renovation.

This house was pretty rough.

So Steven was in a position where he had to upgrade this house.

He needed new windows.

He needed new heating cooling system.

He needed new hot water heating.

And we said, let’s think about doing this a little bit differently.

Make your house more comfortable and save you a lot of money in the long term.

So he listened to our advice and we’ve got a really good house now.

So maybe Steven, you can tell us from the standpoint of being a homeowner and acquiring a project

house.

What was it about the work that Clay and Adam do with fuel switch that compelled you to

work with them on the project?

Well, I know Adam personally before and we had sat down and talked about it and Clay

hit on the big point, which is I had to do everything.

But when you sit around and you think about the economics of it, we’re talking about

Delta’s, a normal standard historical furnace that people put in versus an air source heat

It’s not the focus of the air source heat pump.

It’s what’s that Delta.

And that’s what I had to keep coming back to and with all being electric and then having

the solar, there’s a payback period.

So from an economic standpoint, it made a lot of sense.

And then from doing what’s right for the world standpoint, I believe it made a lot of sense

so because I do believe in climate change and I believe that every little bit helps

especially.

I’m one house out of thousands and thousands in the area, but you guys start somewhere.

And these guys were a conduit to allowing me to open my eyes to see that I could be one

of the first to do that net energy neutral and start that process.

Well, tell you, I want to first of all thank you for inviting us into your home and sharing

this with our community and our audience.

And I’m really struck.

I can just tell talking with you that what you’ve been able to do here, what you’ve been

able to create here feels wonderful.

And it’s a great space to be inside of.

It’s so comfortable.

And I’m curious, you were barefoot earlier when we got here.

It’s obviously a very comfortable space.

Can you just share with us a little bit about that experience you have?

Yeah, I mean, there’s the physical comfort, obviously, of this stuff works.

The technology’s there.

And when it’s cold out, I can be warm in here and when it’s warm out, I got air conditioning

in here that I didn’t think I was going to get through the air source heat pump.

But it does.

There’s that physical feeling.

But there’s also, at my other house where I used to live, I had a furnace.

And every time I’d walk into the winter and be warm, it maybe it’s me, but I had a little

bit of a guilt.

I’m like, because I know why it’s hot.

It doesn’t burn any combustion.

I’ve got combustion.

I have a fossil fuel that are burning.

That’s not good for the environment.

I don’t have that guilt here as much at all.

I come in and it’s like, it’s hot.

It’s like, oh yeah, all that solar energy during the day that I collected is now heating

my house at night so I can sit down and watch it on movie.

I love this.

So in a sense, we could say that with fuel switch, you too can feel good about feeling good.

Right?

It’s a fabulous change.

The way I use energy, the solar tubes I was talking about, they have LED lights.

And I don’t turn the lights on in those rooms at night because these night lights are bright

and they’re not powered each day.

They charge back up.

When I make it to silent to make for dinner, a lot of times I’m like, ah, pasta, I got

to boil the water and it’s going to take so long and I’m like, oh wait, it’s induction.

It’s like a microwave.

The water is going to boil that quick and I’m going to be eating faster than I can make

a sandwich, but I’m going to be making pasta.

I mean, it changes the way I think and the way I use it.

That’s fabulous.

That’s fabulous.

And Clay, I want to ask you, before we go on this tour and I understand we’re going

to be getting down in the crawl space underneath, I want to share with us what’s your background

and how did you get to where you’re at now today helping folks make the fuel switch?

That’s great.

Thanks.

My background is construction.

I’ve been a general contractor for years doing high-end home remodels, kitchens, bathrooms,

new construction.

I always was trying to emphasize energy efficiency in all of those projects, but again, I realize

that I think there’s something more that we can do.

And when we started this company, I connected with Adam and we decided to launch this company

and everything did very well together.

Adam has the experience with building science, with software development, with energy modeling

and I’ve actually been in the trenches pulling building permits and crawling on roofs and

building things.

It was a real fun symbiosis.

So now we’re really focused on getting people off of fossil fuels and by having a general

contractor type experience, we can look at the whole house as a system rather than the

individual components and come up with the right solution for each house.

And I got to tell you, it’s really fun and it feels really good.

That’s fabulous.

That’s fabulous.

So I guess we’re going outside first, right?

Let’s go underneath the house.

That’s where it all happens.

That sounds fun.

All right.

Great.

Thanks.

All right.

So Clay, here we are, we’re about to go down into the crawl space and there’s a lot of

magic happening down there that wouldn’t otherwise be obvious.

You know, it’s a part of the house that a lot of people don’t think about very much,

but it’s actually really important for energy and for comfort.

So let me show you what we did here.

Great.

Good thing I’m doing some yoga.

So Clay, here we are under the house in the crawl space and what are we looking at?

Well, again, what Adam was saying earlier, the first step is energy efficiency, which

we talk about insulation and air sealing.

There are two different things.

They work very well together.

The insulation we like to say is like a wool sweater, keeps you nice and warm, but if

you’re outside with the wool sweater and the wind blows, you’re going to feel cold.

Air sealing would be like that windbreaker that goes over the top of your wool sweater.

And if you wearing both the windbreaker and the wool sweater, you’re going to feel warm,

same thing with your house.

That makes a ton of sense.

So, crawl spaces are generally quite leaky, especially in older houses.

So what we’ve done here is we’ve wrapped the whole perimeter of the crawl space with a

foil-based insulation that seals air from getting in and out as well as has a thermal barrier

to it with the insulation.

We’ve also used quite a bit of expanding foam to seal any holes in the house.

And then what we’ve done down here is we’ve got a vapor barrier, a vapor and moisture barrier

on the floor.

In addition to making this space as pleasant as a crawl space to be, works to keep moisture

from the ground from getting into the space, keeping this dry, keeping mold down.

And in Colorado, radon is a big issue.

So in this house, we have a radon mitigation system that is drawing air from underneath

the barrier to remove radon and prevent radon from getting into the house.

That’s great.

So with a few very simple pieces of technology here, you’re accomplishing quite a lot.

It’s really quite simple.

We call this the low-hanging fruit.

We apply these same concepts to the walls and the attic above, not as easy to show in

a video podcast, but it works great.

And this space stays warm now, and that keeps the floors of stairs warm.

So when Steven gets out of bed in the morning with his bare feet, he’s going to be stepping

on to much warmer floors than this house used to have before all this work was done.

Which, like he was saying earlier, is just really pleasant.

Right, yeah, we know there’s a sort of psychosomatic aspect to our experience of comfort in

a home, and that the temperature of the floor is actually a huge driver of that, isn’t it?

It’s a big driver, and a lot of people wake up and feel cold feet, and they might turn

their thermostat up.

Right, right, right.

But really, they just need to seal and condition their crawl space.

Oh, it’s so easy.
