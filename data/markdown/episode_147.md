Welcome to the YonEarth community podcast. I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today

we’re visiting with Sheila Foster, the executive director of the biodynamic demeter alliance

and Sheila it’s so great to have this opportunity to visit with you today. Thank you it’s really

nice to be here Aaron. As you probably noticed I almost stumbled on biodynamic demeter alliance

because and we’ll chat about this for a moment later on it’s the new name resulting from

the recent merger of two different organizations that have been so instrumental in advancing the

biodynamic farming agriculture gardening and land stewardship movement and I’m just so thrilled

Sheila that we have this opportunity to chat about this because it’s one of the things that’s very

near and dear to my heart. Thanks yeah it’s a humble name I think at some point in our branding

process we’re gonna have to figure out how to make it less of a tongue tire. I can get used to a

biodynamic demeter alliance I just just did a wrong copy time. Absolutely. Sheila Foster has worked

across the spectrum of the environmental and food system movement for more than two decades. A

successful nonprofit leader and scientist at heart her work has focused on the belief that

hope for the world lies in the intricate web that ties us all together and our ability to nurture

and care for each other the soil and our fellow living beings. Through her experience nationally

and internationally she has seen that one of the greatest avenues for creating a thriving world

is through the principles and values of biodynamic agriculture. A mother and a fan of walking

any time she can. Sheila spends whatever free time she has enjoying her daughter walking in the

woods and connecting with her local community. She lives in southern Oregon on lands that have

been stewarded since time immemorial by the Tacelma, Lutagua and Shasta peoples and Sheila I last

summer had the opportunity to travel right through your neck of the woods as it were with my sweetheart

Karesa and was there the year prior with my son Hunter it’s such a special magical land where

you’re located maybe just just to kick us off and just to give us a sense of the place where we’re

speaking with you today tell us a bit about what what it’s like in your region right now.

Yeah I I love this region you know it’s a very unique place in the world because it has two

mountain ranges it has the Cascades and it has the Siscus and it’s one of the only places in the

world that has two mountain ranges that meet so you have an east west and north south mountain

range which means that if you live in town you’re surrounded by mountains on three sides which is

really just spectacular beautiful pine trees and deciduous forests and

it’s been a really special place you know there’s hot springs and stuff here and so this this

area actually sit for thousands of years as a place where people came for healing because of the

hot springs and you can still feel it today there’s something in the air and I’ve loved living here

I’ve been here for close to 20 years now and it’s just one of those special places in the

world and today it is 80 degrees and the leaves are starting to change and it’s beautiful.

I can just I can just picture it and I absolutely love that part of our world or continent

Turtle Island and thanks for thanks for painting that picture for us. So biodynamics and we’ve

got such an important announcement to share in this podcast episode which is a very special conference

coming up in November right here in Colorado and Westminster between Denver and Boulder

Colorado where many from around North America are going to be gathering to celebrate and share

and learn and teach about the biodynamics movement and Sheila in addition to the conference this

is also a very special time right because we’re coming up on the 100 year anniversary of the

biodynamic movement and maybe just to cue all that up for you can you just walk us into I know a

lot of our audience is familiar with biodynamics but not everybody can you just walk us through what

what is biodynamics why is it different from some of the other agricultural methods out there

and how did it how did they come to be yeah that’s a big question so so right now you’re right we’re

having a national biodynamic conference it’s going to be in Westminster very nicely situated

between Denver and Boulder and it’s November 8th to the 12th and we’re bringing in people from

all over the world we’re bringing in national speakers that we’re very excited to have really the

goal of that conference is you know it’s been four years since we’ve had a national conference

because of the endemic and all the changes that happened in our world and so we’re really excited

to have everybody come together and especially excited that we’re able here in the United States

to launch the 100 year celebration of biodynamics and that started in 1924 and it evolved because

there were farmers in Europe that were very concerned about what was happening because we were

two had happened there were lots of weapons that were leftover chemicals from those weapons that

were leftover and it was discovered that they could be used as fertilizers for the soils and

farmers were really concerned about what they saw happening and so they went to an Austrian

philosopher and scientist named Rudolph Steiner and they said help us we don’t know what to do here

we’re concerned this is going to impact the nutrients and the nutritional quality of the food

we don’t know what the environmental damage is going to be but really frankly they were primarily

concerned about what was happening to the quality of the food and Steiner is a very wise human being

and he agreed that this was a problem that needed to be addressed and eventually through the

years got talked into holding a series of lectures eight lectures and it’s those eight lectures

that formed the foundation of the principles of biodynamics and from there

there’s people came to the United States it started spreading around the world and Europe

is demeter is the certification and biodynamics and demeter certification is the most trusted

certification in Europe there’s thousands of farms that are demeter certified it really was the

basis of the organic movement and today any demeter certified farm starts with a foundation of

meeting the organic standards and then goes beyond that there the United States for one reason or

another it didn’t take off as fast and as quickly as it did throughout Europe but it’s starting to

really take hold particularly in the wine industry and I think the main reason for that is that

vineyards are very concerned about quality of course they’re producing a product and they are

really interested in being able to find the individuality of the land on which the grapes are grown

and so biodynamic practices are all about that it’s really about so one of the things that I

often think about with biodynamics is you know Rudolph Steiner also created Waldorf education

and one of the aspects of Waldorf education is that as a teacher your job is really to find

individuality of your of the child that you’re teaching and to bring that forth so a lot of

other education programs it’s you know opening up the child’s mind and pouring knowledge in and

through Waldorf education the belief is a lot more about finding how that what’s the gift that

this child is bringing into the world and how to use the teacher and lie in that and bring that

forth as a biodynamic farmer it’s a really similar philosophy how as a farmer do you look at your

land and so one of the aspects of biodynamics is that they look at the farm as one whole organism

so how do you as a as a farmer how do you bring a lie that individuality what is the gift that

this land can bring and how do you work in the relationships between all the beings that are on

your land to grow food and be a thriving community and so that’s really the foundations all the

practices and principles are based around that idea of how do we create a a thriving and

livened ecosystem that can produce food that nourishes people and it really holds what is the

essence of that plant that fruit whatever it is that the food is and so you know sourcing your

fertility close to the farmer on the farm building compost pile is building soil really working with

the soil to build up those microbial relationships that happen between the plants and the microbes in

the soil there’s preparations that are created that are used to help jump starts the compost files

and get that microbial action going the livestock is a very important part of a biodynamic farm because

you know it’s seen as a whole ecosystem and so rather than where there’s a lot of agro businesses

you know you have giant feed lots with all the cattle crammed into a pen and things like that which

beyond um not being sustainable environmentally is obviously horrible for the animals and so

making sure that we’re treating all of the beings animals and plants on our land with respect to end

and thinking about what they need that’s a really important aspect so like you don’t cut the horns

off the cattle you know you’re you’re not clipping the horns off the goats things like that um

so there’s this honoring of all of the creatures on your land and then that full cycle that those

creatures bring you know they eat the plants and the ground cover and then the manure that they

leave behind can then nourish the plants and it becomes you’re keeping a nutrient cycle and that’s

the real meaning of regenerative and so biodynamic in many ways goes beyond regenerating the land

it’s restoring the land and then it continues to regenerate so many many times people can go

if farmers have gone on to land that folks have said this you can’t do anything with this land it’s

it’s gone good luck and then they’ll start implementing biodynamic practices and low and

behold this life springs for it because it’s this cultivation of the life the life force that’s

there on that land so what do we do what do we need to do to bring that forward so I think um

there are a whole host of reasons why people become biodynamic farmers but I think ultimately

people continue farming biodynamically because it’s successful you end up with wonderful

production you end up with beautiful crops you end up with a life that is much more rewarding

you’re not just a cog in the wheel as a farmer you’re actually they’re interacting with your land

in a really positive way and um I think that’s what all farmers want whether they’re biodynamic or not

and biodynamic practices gives you a pathway to build those relationships yeah it’s it’s it’s so

beautiful and it just gives me this deeper sense of hope Sheila hearing about

about where biodynamics come from the origin story if you will and how biodynamics are helping

us in communities worldwide at this point and you know right here I’m I’m located at Elk Run farm

a small drylands agro ecology farm outside of Boulder and Lions Colorado that is one of the

uh farms on your curated visit schedule for the upcoming conference and here my my friends

Nick D. Dominico and Risa Pulaski each of whom have had their own individual podcast episode we

call it the his and hers pairing um set right in this amazingly abundant garden sanctuary that’s

been created in a in a location that was really degraded verging on desertified through

poor management practices and this is already a semi-arid region right so if things are not being

cared for in a certain way and if the natural uh cycles with the ruminants and you know

pre-colonialization here of course the buffalo the bison the elk were uh doing their thing and

keeping the regenerative cycles intact as a result but nowadays uh it’s it’s the willful

intent of the farmers and land stewards like Nick and Risa and of course our friends

brick and rows up at sustainable settings a few hours from here are doing such

extraordinary work and I’ve experienced this firsthand right so I have in my own embodied

knowledge uh the understanding of of what’s really possible and I know for many of us who

haven’t yet experienced this directly there there’s a really special invitation in all of this to

not only hear the knowledge and and pursue the understanding in terms of a cognitive awareness

but but also to visit some of these places and experience the various foods and wines and offerings

that are coming from these very special uh farms these very special uh relationships and I think

that’s another key in all of this it’s not the industrial model as you’re saying it’s very much

a a relationship-based model of reverence reciprocity respect this is really important especially in

these times in my opinion Sheila um and you know I I ended up writing a novel about all of this

called VeridiTos right and in the story the characters the main character Brigitte so if you

actually visits several of the farms that you guys are including on your tour at the conference

and so on just I’m so excited how this is all kind of weaving together and I wanted to just read a

quick quote from here that is quoting Rudolph Steiner uh and he said and and this is really echoing

what you’re saying about the origins uh after after the World War I with the chemical-based agriculture

really coming online he said the most important thing is to make the benefits of our agricultural

preparations available to the largest possible areas over the entire earth so that the earth

may be healed and the nutritive quality of its produce improved in every respect this is a problem

of nutrition nutrition as it is today does not supply the strength necessary for manifesting the

spirit in physical life a bridge can no longer be built from thinking to will and action food plants

no longer contain the forces people need for this and so this is obviously getting a bit outside

the box of how we ordinarily think and talk about agriculture and practice agriculture and I think

what Steiner’s articulating for us is is incredibly profound and I’m curious if you might

share with us opine with us for a few minutes what what your experience is of this wellspring

of wisdom that Rudolph Steiner has shared with the world well I think it’s really interesting you’re

there’s been some research that’s been done quite a bit actually around nutrition and the impact

of nutrition and one of the things that I found really interesting was the you know as a human

being the cell that created you as a human being was actually a cell so women are born with all

of their eggs intact and so the cell that created me was actually created in my grandmother’s body

right so that is a really interesting thing when you think about this whole nutrition aspect

because Steiner was writing those words back in 1920 1930 and here we are a hundred years later

and so it’s actually my generation your generation that are feeling the impacts of what

Steiner was talking about back in the 1920s right there was this ability to kind of

crawl our way through it up until now and I think we’re starting to see the very real impacts

of exactly what was being talked about you know you um we have enormous problems with obesity and

we can there’s all kinds of reasons for that right part of the reason is you know the way our agriculture

system is where it heavily promotes all kinds of foods that aren’t actually as they’re not only

not as nutritional as we need but their the whole diet isn’t as healthy as we need it to be so there’s

all kinds of reasons of people have to you know one of the problems I think by a dynamic food is

that often it’s priced out of reach for a lot of people that really that’s something that we

all as a community need to find a way to tackle is how do we make truly nutritious food

accessible to everybody it should not be that there’s this divide in that that the

hasn’t has not literally means that the have not will not have access to really nutritious food

like I used to work in the farm to school world and it’s an enormous divide that can happen for

children once they hit about second grade and you know you have the kids that have wealth and are

able to bring their own lunches to school and and these are all these organic foods and all

this other stuff and then you have the kids that are being fed you know processed food and all

the rest of the stuff and and it’s they both have to go into class after lunch and take the same

math test you know and is that fair so there’s all of these equity issues that are tied into it

and all sorts of things like that and I think I think Siner was seeing that he was seeing the

this life force that as a humanity we need to have in heavens when have we needed a life force

more than now right like all of these problems that um people were predicting and Siner was in

the lead of all of that that people were predicting we’re going to be problems they’re now

the the chickens have come home to roost thank you very much and we need to start dealing with it

and so I think um it’s made it so that biodynamic practices in terms of their ability to

store water with the way in which soil is taken care of the importance of biodiversity

and what’s happened with the loss of biodiversity the nutritional value all of those practices

are things our world really needs and included in that is the need to take a step back and say okay

what’s really important here we don’t need to be this mechanized civilization that only

thinks about how much profit we’re making all the time of course we have to make sure that farmers

are making money and that communities are making money and we can’t pretend that money is an

important because it is but there are ways in which we can approach that where we can make decisions

about what is the true cost of some of the activities that we’re doing you know there are

you could say that that you know hot house tomato that you pick up at some conventional grocery store

is cheaper than that beautiful biodynamic tomato that you pick up from your local farmers market

but the cost that actual environmental cost the human cost the health cost that like

cert adding those dollars and cents onto that vegetable that has chemicals that have been sprayed

soil that’s been degraded nutritional value that’s been degraded those are enormous costs that

all of us are bearing so let’s do a reset let’s look at okay how do we take all of those costs

into account and start actually paying the farmers that are doing the right thing the money that

they need to make a living so they want to keep doing it and create a world that is actually

sustainable for us and for future generations and take responsibility in that way and hold

companies to that standard and say it’s not good enough anymore you can’t just you know have

your profits for your shareholders we all our shareholders this is our planet we all need to be able

to have a say in how this world is taking care of

that so so beautifully put Sheila and my goodness we have a project ongoing right now related

to regenerative finance and ecosystem economics right and so so much of what you’re speaking to

extends way beyond you know what we think of when we’re talking about agriculture and food

per se into this entire human experience and experiment that we’re participating in world

wide right now and it is really clear I think to so many of us that we we really have a lot to

heal and transform and thankfully there are a number a growing number perhaps of amazing folks

really engaged in that healing and transformational work and one of the things I’m super excited

about with the work you’re doing and the upcoming conference is is how you’re convening so many

amazing folks on these topics speaking giving workshops and lectures and and I wanted to maybe

just ask you about a few of the folks that’ll be at the conference to share with our audience

and really encourage folks by the way I you can go to biodynamicconference.com to register

and encourage you to do so there there are tours to farms in the area as part of the programming

and then out the west and hotel several days of programming right then and there maybe maybe

Sheila you could tell us a bit about some of the speakers who will be there and some of the

experiences folks can have by attending the conference. Yeah so opening the conference I was so

excited when Liz Carlisle said yes so Liz Carlisle has written a phenomenal book called Healing

Grounds and it’s looking at traditional ecological knowledge it’s looking at black farmers it’s

looking at a lot of people of color and old traditions and and discoveries that are are coming

you know old knowledge that’s coming back to help steal our earth and so Ida Goosman is

going to be joining her she is Ida is a researcher in the central valley he’s looking at the

relationship between biodiversity above the ground and biodiversity below the ground in terms of

how gardens are planted and things like that but Liz’s book at Yemen had a chance to pick it up

I highly recommend it it’s amazing one beautiful story after the next so she’s opening the

conference or they’re opening the conference because I think one of the things that we’re really

interested in is bringing as many people together as possible and that’s of course the whole biodynamic

community and it’s also there we have so many allies and we all need to be working together

to move our planet towards the direction much of biodynamics is based on very ancient knowledge

that indigenous peoples around the world have been practicing for thousands of years and so

it’s really important for us to create the cities and create the conversations and whatever it takes

so that we’re listening to each other and learning from each other and so that’s kicking the

conference off and we also have constant washburn constant swashburn who’s with

Joanna Macy I don’t know if you know of her work but she has the work that reconnects

so consensus is bringing Joanna Macy’s work to the conference and she’s gonna help kind of

open the ceremony and then we’ll have all kinds of things to to greet people

so that’s one of our keynotes we’re having Nikki Sylvestery as speaking on Friday Nikki

helps create the people’s grocery in Oakland she was the founder of soil and shadow which is

their current organization and she was also the former CEO of Greenfraw which is Van Jones’

organization and so she’s been a wonderful advocate for sustainable regenerative agriculture

and she is now really looking at how do we take those principles and apply those to human systems

so what are the lessons and biodiversity that we can bring to human systems in terms of

human diversity and why that creates a much stronger more resilient community so she’s going to be

talking about ways in which we can nourish ourselves build our organizations because as we’re working

towards this movement that really is trying to change the world we need to understand

we have to take care of ourselves we have to take care of the planet so there’s some wisdom that

we can implement then on Saturday we have the honor of having Woody Tash there and he is going

to be talking about slow money and so the economic aspects and we’ve got Martin King who’s the ED

for Hawthorne Valley is going to join him on stage for a conversation to talk about like what’s

this mean economically how can we be investing in ways that are really taking care of the planet

and then on the last day we have a panel of wonderful amazing biodynamic farmers that are just

going to talk about where is biodynamics and how do we take this into the future and and all through

the whole days we’ve got the field trips that you’ve mentioned on Wednesday on Thursday we have

full day and half day workshops including things like a wine intensive we have an advisor training

for one of the things one of the bottlenecks that we’re finding in the biodynamic movement getting

more practices on the ground as we need more advisors so we’re in the process of launching advisor

training so that farmers with all this knowledge can learn about how to start advising other farmers

and they can retire from their farm and go out and help start new younger farms so there’s all

sorts of workshops happening on Thursday and then one of the things that we’re doing that I’m

really excited about is we have workshops each morning where you sign up for one workshop and for

three days you’ll attend the same workshops so it builds on itself and we’ve got a wide variety of

people who are teaching that one of the workshops I’m really excited about with that is with the

honor of Winona Ladouque and her mother Betty Ladouque are coming and they are leading a workshop

on finding your voice through art and action so really helping all of us discover what

where is our voice and trying to create this change and then we have Penny Livingston who’s

a big fan of the Dryland Ecology Center and Gavin Gonzalez who’s working on a

place similar to the Dryland Ecology Center in Mexico and they’re going to be having a whole water

workshop so we’re excited about that we’ve got another workshop that’s on land access another one

that’s on looking at power and love on a farm and how do we create more equality and farm workers

which is really important you know one of the things that we have in the biodynamic movement

is Seacom and Egypt who’s created the economy of love and so how do how do we start

creating more economies of love and we’re going to have an associate of economic conversation

that’s a three day so we’ve got a lot of that happening and then we have over 40

workshops that happen in the afternoon so the theme for the work for the conferences healing

people into planet and looking towards the next 100 years biodynamics so we have healing spirit

here healing the soil healing so we have all these tracks that you can take that will allow

you to kind of dive into these different aspects of how do we heal as a society and humanity

so that’s just a little blink of what we’re offering yeah so so wonderful she let’s so wonderful

and again folks can go to biodynamicconference.com to register this is November 8 to 12 this year

2023 right here in Colorado in Westminster and surrounding areas for the farm visits

between Denver and Boulder and yeah what an exciting time and what an exciting gathering

I want to be sure to take a moment and just remind folks that this is the YonEarth

community podcast I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today we’re visiting with Sheila Foster

the executive director of the biodynamic demeter alliance the upcoming conference you can go to

biodynamicconference.com to register and learn more about what’s happening here in a few weeks

you can also go to biodynamics.com to get all kinds of additional information about what’s

happening in the movement and I want to be sure to give a shout out to a few of our sponsors who

make the YonEarth community podcast series possible this includes Chelsea Green Publishing which

of course is also a sponsor of the biodynamic conference and with Chelsea Green you can go to our

grown at farms in Colorado that use biodynamic methods so this is a wonderful way to enhance your

own personal self-care health and wellness and support some of these farms as well. Of course a

special shout out to earth heroes sustainable products to profitable purpose consulting to

soil works garden preparations blending biodynamic preps from a number of different farms were

connected to earth coast productions and got to give another shout out to our book VeridiToss which

talks about a lot of these themes and threads and gives a bit of an intro to biodynamics as well

bringing the reader into a biodynamic workshop experience at sustainable settings. You can find

that in many of our other books and resources at wider.org and finally a very special shout out

to all of our ambassadors are growing global network of ambassadors doing regenerative sustainable

stewardship health and wellness work in a variety of contexts and communities. If you haven’t yet

become an ambassador and you’d like to you’ll get a variety of additional perks like access to our

our main interview and for folks who are part of our monthly giving program a huge shout out if

you’d like to give it the $33 or greater level we’re happy to send you a jar of the way they water

soaking salts each month as a thank you so huge shout out to everybody in the community and Sheila I

know that you’ve got a number of wonderful folks and companies sponsoring and supporting the

conference and I wanted to be sure to invite you to share about some of some of those folks who

will be not only making the conference possible but probably will be at the conference and we might

have an opportunity to connect with some of them. Yeah we have a huge list of sponsors so very very

grateful for all of those sponsors. Fox Hollow Farm is one of our sponsors and we’re all excited

because they’re going to be bringing some of their beautiful beef and we’ll be able to provide that

at the wine and cheese welcome when they when folks first arrive and then they’ll also be at the

biodynamic showcase and that’s one of the things that’s a little different with this year’s

conferences on Saturday from noon until six we’re hosting a biodynamic showcase and that is open

to the general public it’s only $30 dollars and you get three tastes of wine and for another

$5 you can have another three tastes and you get a super cute little wine glass that’s got the

logo on the front the demeter logo and the biodynamic demeter alliance logo so that’ll have tons

of vendors there I’m hoping that some of your sponsors of Y on earth are going to I think there’s

a number of them I know that are going to be there so that’s an opportunity to actually come and

talk to producers and wine makers in particular we expect to have over 40 different

rivals of biodynamic wine there for folks to taste another sponsor that’s going to be there is

JPI and the Josephine Porter Institute is an institute of the biodynamic movement that we all

love in the door and one of one of the things they do is have preparations but the other thing they do

is they have an amazing bookstore and so they’re going to have a bookstore at the conference but they’ll

also have a bookstore at the biodynamic showcase so we’re very excited about that the earth and

humanity foundation is sponsoring we also have Mercola is one of our sponsors and they’re going

to be at the showcase as well with all of their beautiful soul spraying products we also have the

biodynamic demeter the biodynamic federation demeter international is going to be in attendance

since so there’ll be some international products that are at the showcase

and we’ve had so many wonderful sponsors that have come forward like Neil and Sun suit there’s

a lot of management of the vineyards in Napa Valley and they’re sponsoring our our scholarship

campaign so we’re right in the middle right now of a really important scholarship campaign because

for many farmers and young people frankly it’s just too expensive to try to

fly to the conference pay for the hotel room and and and all that’s involved with that and so we

want to make this as accessible as possible and so um the scholarship campaign is a way in which

we do that so they’ve helped to to provide funding for that um we’ve also had you know slow money

as one of our sponsors which is really nice of course Chelsea green so um we have had

tons and tons of wonderful people that are sponsoring the trend in your many of the vineyards

they’re sponsoring the um the conference in the showcase so we’re very very lucky and if you go

to biodynamics.com or you go to biodynamicsconference.com you’ll find a list of all the sponsors

and one of the things that is exciting that we’re putting out at this year’s conference is a biodynamic

flavor guide and that will have a list of all the demeter certified producers in the united states

as well as regional groups and it’s a great resource just you know if you’re wondering

who else is in your state you can just stand down as lists and there’s a phone number or an email

you can reach out to them and all of our sponsors have advertisements in that um publication as well

so it’s made our conference program close to 80 pages long but it’s a resource that hopefully

folks want to keep for a long time. So great Sheila yeah what an extraordinary

opportunity you know for folks to have these experiences to connect directly and to have

resources that will last indefinitely what a what a wonderful opportunity and I’m just I’m

so thrilled this is happening here in Colorado and you know we participated in the conference at

Lake George back in 2019 before the pandemic I let a workshop we had a booth and had so much fun and

yeah here we are I guess four four years later and boy I know there are probably a whole lot of us

really looking forward to getting together and and sharing in that fellowship in that community and

camaraderie that we get to experience in person. Yeah zoom is awesome but it’s not the same as being

there. Yeah no doubt about it. Well I am I’m so thrilled we’ve had the opportunity to visit and

you know we’ll we’ll do our behind-the-scenes segment and and dive a little deeper into some of

your own personal story and background for our ambassadors and again if you’re not yet an

ambassador and like to become one you can go to winers.org to get that process started but I want

to ask also Sheila your your role as executive director you’ve had a number of leadership roles

with Rob Valley Farms School the development director rola lomo katsi restoration project hopefully

I’m saying that correctly also development director at science works hands-on museum you’ve

been in a number of leadership roles and have done a lot to build capacity at various organizations

working on these interconnected issues I want to ask you as an organizational leader what what are

you most excited about with this recent merger of demeter on the one hand in the bio dynamic

association on the other hand and and maybe you can give us a little insight into okay so we’re

thinking a bit about the next 100 years but maybe the next two three four five years from the

organization what are what are some of the things you guys are looking forward to that you’re

particularly enthusiastic about as as executive director yes you know one of the things that

we did pretty early on the organization was formed in January and then by November we had

so much a year ago we had a retreat where we brought everybody together you know one of the

big challenges with a national organization is like ours is that we’re fully remote and so

being able to bring everybody together is really fantastic and it’s really important in terms

of being able to build understanding and and get ideas that we can bounce off each other so in

November we had a retreat and point raised California and we identified four priority areas for

the organization and one priority area was to look at how do we better support farmers

who are doing the right thing and trying to regenerate the earth but they’re not really getting

paid for it because right now they have to embed all of that work in that bunch of carrots or

that head of lettuce that they’re trying to sell and it’s not an economically sustainable model

and so we want to find some ways in which farmers can get paid for the ecosystem services that

they’re providing so that was one priority area is they’re working on that on the international

level with the biodynamic federation demeter international they’ve been piloting an app that

they’re using in Europe and in Egypt and in South America and we want to bring that to the

United States so that it can eventually we could have farmers that are able to use this technology

they enter in their different practices attracts the value of those practices based on the research

that they spokes done and that generates an invoice that we can then take to local government

entities to companies would have you so that’s finding a pathway for farmers to be able to be paid

for more than just the crops that they grow so that was one priority area the other priority area

that we identified was what are the suite of services that we can be offering as an organization

that’s really going to help support and grow the biodynamics in the United States so what do people

need so they need education programs we need a stronger communication we need to be able to do

different things so over the last year we’ve been looking at you know how do we change our

former training program so that we can bring in more students can we have more online can we have

more youtube type quick and educational videos like what are the things that resonate with what

people mean so that’s the second area was developing the suite of services then national conferences

in that suite of services okay we need to work in dinner so let’s bring everybody together

cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in case you wondered to bring all these people together

how do we do that but that’s our job we’re going to do it so um so that’s one place uh and what

and if the priorities is the suite of services and then um a third priority area was how do we grow

and what are ways in which we can grow the marketplace so we have a whole branding effort

that’s been underway that we’ve been working on for the last year of really trying to get the word

out about biodynamics what does it mean to be biodynamic what does it mean for

demeter certification how does all that work together why is it important for the consumer to

be thinking about uh biodynamics and to be supporting demeter certified producers so that was

and should we have an online marketplace are there things we can do in terms of economic

development regionally and locally so looking at those sorts of the building the marketplace for

biodynamics and that’s the the real work of the third sphere of the biodynamic demeter alliance

we have three spheres one is demeter which is the certification the other is the cultural sphere

which is kind of the work that was what the biodynamic association did for close to 100 years

and that was all the education the research all of that and then the third is economic development

market development so that’s our third priority for this next year is how do we create something

that is going to be that’s really going to grow the biodynamic community or uh sorry uh grow the

biodynamic marketplace and then the fourth priority area is um to be able to

recruit more producers to get demeter certified and recruit more producers to be practicing

more biodynamic agriculture so that is the you know there’s other areas that I listed those other

three priority areas are all sort of pathways to be able to increase the implementation of biodynamics

on the ground so those are those are the areas that we identified and now we’re coming close to

having been through that for a year and so uh immediately following the conference we’re going

to be meeting again and saying okay we’ve had a year looking at those now we’ve had a chance to

bring everybody together which does that look like and then um how is it that we can um take the

knowledge that what we hear from the community and put that into practice as the national organization

to really move the movement forward how do we best serve the biodynamic movement how do we best

serve the planet that’s what we’re working on it’s it’s it’s so so exciting Sheila and I know that

many of us here at the Y honors community are engaged in some related similar projects and so I

can just feel the excitement and enthusiasm about what’s happening in our world right now like it’s

such a challenging time on the one hand and it’s such an extraordinarily hopeful and and

figurating time on the other and it is up from my perspective having been a a fan and an observer

of the biodynamic movement over these past several years um I got to say that I’m just I’m really

um energized around what’s happening and with your leadership and others in the uh leadership

and management and the board of the biodynamic demeter alliance it’s it’s just so uh invigorating

and and hopeful again to use that word uh the leadership you guys are exhibiting and uh what

what a what a fun wonderful uh opportunity we have in a handful of weeks here to get together

and celebrate in person thank you yeah I mean one of the roles that I had was I was the development

director from our inorganic which is um was started by super fondly who um has cowbro cheese and

um born Weber who was part of the original group that wrote the organic standard so these were

like the the four four parents of the organic movement were there and we’re in and um it was so

lovely to have the chance to work with them and that really inspired me to see what was possible

because this was 20 years ago and we were able by working with government agencies we were able

to create the first all organic county and the nation and we were able to really change people’s

ideas on who their farmers were you know by the time we were finished with or not finished but

you know as the years went on we had farmers where they would walk in the room and everybody would

stand up and get them a standing ovation and it was really fun to see that that change happened

in the community which wasn’t only great for the farmer it was really great for the community and

I really think that um we can do that is the by dynamic movement working with other

organizations that are allies that you know they may be by a dynamic they may be not by a dynamic

but they’re very much thinking along the same lines and working with local government working

with state governments you know we just need to shift people’s perception a little bit we need

it we need a paradigm shift where at this place there’s an amazing time in humanity and we

we need to we need to step in and be those leaders right so you know as we’re thinking about

all those children that are in these schools that we’re trying to find the gifts that they have

in these farmers that are looking at the gift of the land we need to turn to ourselves and think

okay what’s the gift that we’re supposed to be bringing back to this world we we landed on this

planet for a reason let’s use this time really wisely let’s make this place all that it can be

let’s help and lie them the wonderful world in which we live and that’s what I think this conference

can be that’s what the showcase can be because it’s going to take all kinds of people it’s going to

take people that are you know not everybody’s going to be a farmer but everybody eats and so we all

have an opportunity three times a day or more to make a decision as to what does our world look like

and that’s what we need to be thinking about all the time so absolutely wonderful Sheila what a joy

well thank you so much I know it’s an extremely busy time for you preparing in these last

few weeks ahead of the conference we’re so excited to have the opportunity to visit with you today
