Welcome to the YonEarth Communities Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast.

Today we are visiting with Trammell Crow.

Hey Trammell, hello.

Good to see you.

Good to see you.

You know that?

Since last night.

And this is a very special episode because we’re also joined by Joni Clark, who is one

of our premier ambassadors at the YonEarth community and who’s also on our global

advisory board.

So Joni, so glad you could be here with us also.

Well thrilling and exciting, especially to be here in Dallas with you Trammell and all

you do.

So I’ve been working to do this.

And thank you for coming in last night for the half-earth day that we had April 22 being

our day, October 22 being half-earth day and we had 500 people, the fabulous celebration.

And another million in the sidelines waiting.

Mm-hmm.

They didn’t know.

I never made it there.

Once again, the invitation they’ll be here too.

Well, I’ll tell you, we got a lot to talk about and I’m really excited and before we

dive in, let me just share with our audience a little about you and your background, Trammells.

So Trammells Crowe is Dallas, Texas-based, businessman, philanthropist, entrepreneur and

innovative leader in business development and operations.

He is the founder of Earth Day Texas, the world’s largest Earth Day celebration, which in

2011 transformed into Earth X.

The world’s largest environmental expo, conference and film festival, which takes place every

April and Dallas, Texas, just keeps saying large, world’s largest.

Yeah, it’s a very Texas thing, right?

All right.

And just to give you an idea, in 2019, just this past year, the Earth X had over a hundred

and seventy-seven thousand attendees, 650 exhibitors, each of those representing often

multiple organizations, 6,500 youth, 452 speakers, and was an amalgam of nine different

conferences going on at once, which Trammells, maybe we just dive in right there, what, how

the heck are you doing so much at once?

Well, by not knowing any better, but consistently fighting all four than we can chew and definition

of insanity.

All right.

Good on.

All right.

So, tell us a little about what’s going on with these different conferences and what’s

Earth X all about?

Earth X started as an expo for the public the very first year, nine years ago, around the

time of Earth Day.

We had a two-day festival with the exhibitors and forty thousand people.

I say exhibitors, and that means the Sierra Club, the University of Georgia, corporations,

little companies that sell solar paneling to the public, but mainly an educational thing

for the general public to come see, become aware, and learn more.

We all need to do that all over America, but mainly in Texas.

And it has become very multifaceted at first where you showed it, you know, maybe a couple

of movies a day.

Now there’s a full-fledged film festival and last year, I think it was, I think it was

69 virtual reality films all about ecology, so again, it was the largest, an investment

forum with startups and venture capital companies, but you say, how did it happen?

We just didn’t go by the rule book, and when corporations said they wanted to have a conference

for corporate sustainability, we did.

When we saw that Austin, Texas has an amazing environmental super conference, they call

it, of hundreds of attorneys, we started one, two.

Now we’ve an ocean conference for scientists and foundations, there will be the global

youth summit which we didn’t mention, we didn’t have this last year, but it will be in Dallas

and they’re moving their headquarters to Dallas.

Wow, that’s fabulous.

Those are 6,500 youth you were talking about, those are the organized school tours, there

are tons more kids than that.

So we did it by not knowing any better, it’s really, really remarkable, really remarkable.

You just see all the excitement and the activity, yours translates into action, which is

the key.

We’re trying, but if there’s a conference, if it’s just a lot of talk talk, don’t worry

about it.

There’s 177,000, 7,000 people who’ve never heard these things before.

So the awareness level is an action item, in my opinion, the Expo, just by environmental

groups showing what they do and kids and families walking by, that’s an action.

I wish this would happen in New York, and if it happened in Washington DC, the politicians

might learn a little bit.

Well that’s a thought.

Or take me think.

Well, you know, in Texas, and I mentioned to you, I lived in San Antonio for a little

while as a kid, you know, Texas is a, it’s a peculiar culture, right?

It’s a unique aspect of the American culture, and it’s a very interesting place to be doing

this kind of work.

And I’ve heard you talk a bit about the conservative niche, and I’m curious if you might expand

on that a little bit.

A good example is, when we first started this, nine years ago, we weren’t sure how this

was going to fly, because we want the public, the business leadership, the political leadership.

And so we started by not exhibiting all of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Directive

goals.

If we did, talk about all these wonderful things to say, but in the world, it would have

been branded as an overall left-leaning event, and that would have been the death knell

of it.

We have stuck straight to ecology, so the exhibits and the conferences concern themselves

with soil, land, air.

We talk about climate change, but we also just talk about air pollution to the populace

here, and they receive that message better.

We talk about wildlife conservation and animal habitat in many different ways, but one

way you can do it here, that you can’t do in San Francisco, is to talk about the benefits

of hunting and fishing for wildlife conservation, responsible hunting and fishing.

Well, that’s been the mainstay of the deer population in America for decades.

Absolutely.

You know, it’s interesting with the Wienerth community, as we’re doing community mobilization

events all around the country.

We’re often working in very conservative communities, and what’s really fun is we find

that caring for land, caring for soil, caring for water, caring for the health and well-being

of our families and loved ones, it seems not to be a partisan issue, it seems to reach

across all sectors of our culture.

Well speaking of hunting, we know also I’ve been Colorado that a whole lot of the land conservation

happening here is the result of a well-managed hunting and fishing framework, and there’s

something interesting going on in Colorado right now, isn’t there that we were just talking

about a bit?

Yeah, last night when we were together, Laura Sidel, of the Captain Planet Foundation and

all the great things that the Turner and Sidel families do, was here talking to us about

the Wolf reintroduction program into Western Colorado, which you say, 17 million acres,

I think, and what you call, are public lands, and I don’t know when people first started

shooting wolves, but the wolves got population in America, went from tens or hundreds of

thousands down to a few hundred wolves.

It’s been restored in many places, now in Colorado, they want to reintroduce the wolves

in the western part of the state.

They have to change legislation to do that.

They’ve got the funding in part of it, is because of the Turner and the Captain Planet Foundation,

and you know, I don’t remember the name of the group that Mike Phillips run, the Rocky

Mountain Wolf project, yeah, so what’s going on is in order to have this on the ballot,

they have to get 20,000 more signatures, yeah, they need a total of 120,000, they’ve got

126,000, yeah, 126,000, they’ve got to have it about December 6th, and I guess the way

the world works is that’s not so much a matter of saying you all go sign a petition because

it’s not online at this time, right, but of contributing to this fund, going to this

website, and contributing dollars so that the, what do you say, 20 different organizations?

Bunches of organizations, 34 groups, yeah, in Colorado, yes, they’re part of this

cloning thousand more signatures, yeah, I’m happy though.

So this is interesting, so folks can go to Rocky Mountain Wolf project.org to support

the effort, and as we know, increasingly there’s a bunch of really beautiful documentaries

on this, and a lot of research showing how wolves are essential to the ecological well-being

of Western landscapes, landscapes all over really, and especially Western Rocky Mountain

landscapes, so be sure to check that out, Rocky Mountain Wolf project.org and support that

effort, we’ve got just a little over a month at the time of this recording, and ordinarily

a little glimpse behind the scenes, we’ve got several recorded episodes between the time

of recording in the time of publication, and this is one will probably accelerate because

it’s such a time sensitive issue, and get this out sooner and later, so that folks hear

about this in the month of November, and can take action before that deadline in early

December, and you know, it’s all about action tremble, and it’s all about mobilizing,

and I’m just, I’m absolutely struck, and it’s so impressed by the way you’re mobilizing

folks all over, and I’m really curious, 2020 coming up to big year, right, tell us why

is it such an important year, what’s going to be happening in 2020, April 22, 2020 is

the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, Earth Day, maybe you youngsters out there don’t know

how important that was, that was a galvanizer of environmental movement, and everything

done before that was really called contravation, and wasn’t something that pervaded our lives,

and now as you all know, it’s dropped by drop, bit by bit, picked up a piece of plastic,

biopiece of plastic, so that’s what kicked off in April 22, 1970.

This coming April 22, 2020 is the 50th anniversary, there will be many, many people and organizations

all over the country celebrating and doing other things, so the our 10th event, we will celebrate,

so to speak, this 50th, by April 22, in Dallas, having major figures from those errors, I don’t

know, we have, I don’t, Mr. Ralph Nader has not said he’s coming, but hey Ralph, we want you

to come, you’re right, a lot of active people, Senator,

Mrs. Nader.

Yeah, well I know, right, if he doesn’t, but we do along the lines, Senator Gaylord Nelson

was the guy, the governor of Minnesota, I mean, Wisconsin, and the senator of Wisconsin,

who said, there shall be an Earth Day, and he said it in September of 69, but he called

it a teaching, because that’s what they did back then, they sit in, they call it, we have

a teaching, by the time it rolled around in April, it was called Earth Day, 10,000 high

schools, and other schools, and 1,500 universities, all participate in America, it was mainly a national

event, and as a matter of fact, what I have read, is there are more people there, and

all over the country, rather spontaneously, than any civil rights movement event, or any

anti-war movement event in the world, oh my God, that was the environment, so that’s how

important Earth Day is, so Trammell, I imagine a few of our audience members maybe weren’t

yet born in April 20th, 1970, where were you, just take a snack, a little paint-to-picture,

what was different than the now, what’s the same, was that something for better, some

things were worth, obviously there wasn’t the climate change problems at that time, some

had begun, but they were imperceptible, there weren’t ocean plastic problems, there weren’t

ocean acidification, and coral reef dyeing problems, there was air pollution problem,

urban primarily, remember there was acid rain, remember, because of the sulfur emissions from

coal fire plants, and when rivers started catching on fire, and death rates climbed because

of air pollution, the general public rose up and called out, and demanded to be heard,

so Congress and the Senate and the White House were the governments that heard them, and

at that time it was Richard Nixon, so as a Republican, and we’re mainly a Republican

state here, he formed the EPA, and quickly passed various acts, I don’t remember which one

had the first, but the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, as a consequence of April 22,

1970, and through the 70s, many legislations were passed, I guess I didn’t, did I say,

rivers started catching on fire, so that kind of thing stopped, and by the way, let me

mention to those folks, in Santa Barbara, California, who had told me, oh, Tramwell, 1969 was the

first earth guy, okay, okay, they didn’t have it, or they per se, but that big oil spill off the

coast of Santa Barbara then, was really one of the single incidents that started the movement.

Wow, well, you know, we recently had on the podcast Matt Gray, the chief sustainability

officer of the city of Cleveland, and he was talking about the history there with the

river right in the city catching on fire, that’s the guy, yep, yeah, exactly, we’ve got a big

layer going on there, Joni, huh? Okay, let’s, can we just slide that bag over with that

help a little? Sure. This is live, coming at you folks, this is the real world, and we’re

having a real conversation right here in Dallas, Texas, with Tramwell Crow, and so Tramwell,

where were you on that first date? Yeah, where were you looking? All of you swimming? All of

you know, Highland Park High School, right here in Dallas, Texas, and I guess, in 1969, the

60s hadn’t quit quite hit Texas, you know, and so- They were just waiting. I don’t think that

it was on my radar, I don’t think I was even aware of it. I don’t know where it occurred in Dallas,

but it did, and there were old hands, they were there, and in Austin, so no, I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t,

that the original, High School. And Joni, do you remember where you were on the first

Earth day? I was in Minnesota, my family had moved from South Dakota to Minnesota, so we were

just at those schools and listening and learning. But did you celebrate Earth Day on April 22?

Yeah. Oh, I did. Cool. There might have been a little more awareness, you know, in Minnesota than in Texas.

Well, and you know, you just love the outdoors as a kid, you just love the nature, and so it’s just

like yogi bear. You know, that brings up something that I think is part of what your organization

works on. Suburban sprawl, ironically, introduced city people to nature. That’s right. You know,

maybe not just having yards, but three doors down was the end of the neighborhood. Yeah, we’re

field. Yeah, field. We talk about that in New York. Absolutely. And that right now, one of the things

we can do in these suburb and communities is permaculture, the heck out of them, and get the

biodynamic soil activation going. It’s great infrastructure, actually, for food forests,

and so this is part of the work we’re doing promoting, not in communities all over.

Yeah, in one year, you can turn around your whole soil, exact bush in his farmer’s footprint,

creating the research on glycophate, creating cancer, you know, that we now have round up on the way

out so we can now restore our soil and restore. Can you say that again now that we have round up,

how can you wouldn’t know what is this? Well, doctors that push, there’s an amazing doctor

who did much of much of the research on glycophate, which is water soluble, went in

to round up being a plot. Round up being the pesticide. Yes. Yes. By Monsanto. Yes.

That people using their lawns and farm fields, yeah, throughout agriculture, throughout what has

happened. Well, it’s been water soluble. What has happened to the use of it? Yes, and it has

just destroyed the health of the people administering it in their soil. I thought you were saying

it’s been legislation now. So there’s now a series of lawsuits arising because of the science

that Zach Bush has been leading on and we’re seeing increasingly commercial farmers switching back

to organic farming practices, knowing that not only is glycophate poisoning food,

it’s also contributing to extraordinarily high rates of cancer in the farming communities.

Yeah. So this is it’s something we’re all working on. Yeah, you’re back yard. You don’t go

if you use it in your own backyard. Well, I’ve heard there are some states where it’s been banned.

Not yet. That’s interesting. I’m not sure where we are on that.

Well, let me let me ask you. We’re talking a little about the history, thinking 50 years back.

And I’m wondering, Trammell, for you, you know, here you are, you grew up in Texas

from a family and real estate and business. How did you get into the environmental and ecological

work that you’re now leading? Well, the original story of this is real simple. There’s no great

romance to it. My brother taught me three words when I was 12. He taught me other three words.

Yeah, I don’t know if we should say that. But well, environments, population, and politics,

and as soon as I learned those words, they became the most important things to me.

Thank goodness. Environment, population of politics. Yeah. Got it. I like to say,

and he proceeded to forget the first two because he started an active environmentalist.

But that’s not fair. But like many people, I just went about my way of school and college,

and work, and getting married, and kids. So I really wasn’t fully active until my

50s. Finally, I get to do what I want because I’m lucky to have to be able to work full time

and nonprofit. Most people cannot afford to do that. I guess the lesson there is don’t wait

until you’re 50. Don’t retire. You have to balance your life with working on things you believe in,

as well as a vocation. You know, one of the things that I talked about at length in the book Why

Honour is that increasingly as our economy is transforming, as the marketplaces transforming,

there are more and more careers, both for profit and non-profit, that are engaged and regenerative

in conservation oriented in restoration and sustainability oriented business practices.

And it’s so exciting doing a lot of work with youth knowing that they’re looking ahead to a future

where there are all kinds of job opportunities that are doing great work for the world, for the

environment and for people. You can go work in a green job and a plastic company. Who would have thought?

So a little while ago you said something about forest food, food forests. So this is mimicking

some of the natural stacking of layers of tall trees, medium height trees, shorter trees, shrubs,

etc. All producing different types of foods, nuts, fruits, etc. It’s a perennial strategy related

to permaculture to give more diversity and food production in our homes, our gardens, our yards,

which also has a wonderful side benefit of creating more habitat for pollinators for important insects.

So are you saying it’s a matter of where you plant the trees and where you plant the underbrush?

Yes, in different types of trees to grow the nuts and the fruits that are climate appropriate.

So what you might see in a food forest here in Dallas is probably going to be different than what

we would see up in Cleveland in terms of species selection. Where would I see a food forest?

In Dallas, we got to find one. We just did a fabulous tour of an evangelical preacher’s 3.7 acre

permaculture food forest with his family and his kids who did a soil activation. This was up in Ohio

outside of Akron and it’s an episode that will be published fairly soon. North Texas.

And North Texas up there in Ohio. But it would be really cool before

Cleveland for example, there’s an effort working with communities of refugees and immigrants to help take care of

food forests, getting established on vacant lots so that this is actually helping the cities.

Oh, you can go to a half-quad right there and do a food forest.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, I’m sure you’re thinking about this in terms of Texas food forests.

Oh, yeah, I’m sure you’re thinking about this in terms of Texas food forests.

There’s that too and that gets into the whole silver pasture

set of strategies that is being mobilized at larger scales where you’re doing a similar kind of

strategy of having different heights of trees producing nuts and fruits and also doing your

livestock grazing underneath that, which is a strategy for soil building, which we know is one of

the keys to sequestering carbon from that. Let me see here.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Oh, look at that here. There’s a little touch of that.

Yeah. It’s a very short, really.

It’s a travel.

It’s a travel.

Right, you can do that.

So I’ll steer your hand with it.

Yeah, you have a monstrous buck.

That’s why others, the other things, something’s heavy.

So, do you remember where you wrote about it here?

So, you know, in terms of silver pasture and what not, let’s see what’s in here.

This is so brief and so soil focused, it may not be talking about food forests actually.

So it’s all soil stewardages.

This is all soil focused and I got a funny quick story on this.

One of my old buddies that you’re up with played football and baseball with,

he called me after I sent him a copy of why on earth and it was about Christmas time.

And his name is Joe and he called me up and he said,

they said, Aaron, can’t you just boil this all down and tell me what to do?

And I said, Joe, I got the thing for you.

We’re going to in a couple of months have our soil stewardage of handbook out,

which is as full of activities people can do.

You send him the $400, the $400 page.

Yeah, that was the Bible.

But no, we could be doing more resources on the food forest strategies.

And I think it’s a really important angle.

One of the others that we’re starting to produce some content for is

what homeowners associations can be doing.

To stop identifying, to start building soil.

To do that.

Make it out of landscapes.

A manual for that.

That’s cooking.

That’s cooking.

It’s about our office.

Well, it’s probably just a few weeks before we have a very short document

and then probably about a handful of months before we have something a little longer.

Speaking of the biggest.

Yeah, I believe that the biggest homeowner

association management company, I think they’ve got 8,000 HMOs.

What are we going?

And I forget.

Well, it might be 50,000.

It might be 20,000.

Right.

Mr. John Corona here in Dallas.

Who exhibits that?

I mean, it’s.

Oh, very cool.

You see me that at the beginning stage that I’ll send it to him.

That’d be great.

Yeah, maybe he could get started learning.

Yeah, you know, this is the kind of thing wherever we are,

whether it’s a big urban environment like New York City, whether it’s suburban,

whether it’s rural, there’s so much we can all be doing.

And what I love about Earth X is it’s so packed full of solutions,

of information about things going on worldwide, and of

ways people are mobilizing in communities all over.

Okay, so we build a part much.

Trammell Crow Company.

Residential.

Uh, what would a regular garden office, a garden apartment complex,

three-story apartment, you know, your occasional swimming pool, what not.

What would the, uh, property manager and the residents do there?

Yeah, that’s a great question.

So, uh, one of the strategies is to put in community gardens so that the

individuals have access to growing a little bit of their own fresh vegetables

or would have you, which also creates community.

It also, uh, reduces often, uh, crime in some cases where you’ve got more

community interaction, more eyes watching the streets so to speak.

You can also do the food forest strategy so that your landscapes not just

for the visual aesthetic, but is also growing foods,

and in some cases medicinal herbs.

Now, now a key is when we’re doing food in medicinal herbs,

we don’t want any poisons there.

So part of, part of this shifting in mentality and philosophy and psychology is,

hey, we’re not going to spray poisons to make sure that

there’s no blade of grass sticking up between the conqueror would have you.

And we’re going to stop toxifying our environments.

We’re also going to really encourage people to do composting,

which is soil building as opposed to methane producing because when those,

um, when those food wastes and waste paper and all that goes to landfill

we’re just exacerbating the climate crisis.

So as a real estate, we’re a residential developer.

What would I do to learn about, um, offering composting to tenants?

Well, golly, I guess we got to produce some resources for you.

And a whole lot like you.

Yeah, I think it’s a big opportunity.

But wait, you might have to get to know your neighbors.

Well, right.

That’s what they eat.

Yeah, I’m what they eat.

Yeah, I’m what they, I think a lot of us would agree that in our country right now,

we’ve got a real cultural crisis and we’ve got a real divisiveness out there

that we can heal upon the reasons because we don’t know our neighbors.

You know, part of it is, and I love there’s a quote from President Franklin Roosevelt.

He said, a nation that destroys its soil destroys itself.

And I imagine there’s got to be a corollary there,

which is a nation that heals its soil heals itself.

And it could be that as our communities are mobilizing around these

soil installations, gardening, food forests,

that also means we’re healing our communities.

Well, you got that quote down.

I need that.

I need to use that.

I’ll give that to you.

Absolutely.

Well, I love that.

I think I’ll hang on that.

I got some more questions to you.

You already said that.

Also, you know, when asked when you met at R.D.

you met Jerome who did the, he’s at Promo Culture Guru there.

They’ve wrote the book on the Greenhouses.

Jerome Austin.

Austin County, of course.

A book, and if not, I’ll get you one.

But that’s a real important piece for developers.

When you send it to us.

I will.

I will.

So again, as a developer.

Residential apartments, the gardens you said, the composting you said.

What about just a regular office building?

I don’t mean 50-storey building.

Check this out.

I think we’ve got a huge opportunity here.

I think that we know through the research that indoor air quality in office buildings is

particularly bad, because we’ve got a lot of materials off-gassing, computers, finishes,

paints, furniture, all kinds of things, carpets.

And we also know, get this, that certain species of plant are very, very good at filtering

air, carcinogens in particular.

The very best is the spider plant is the household name.

We can get the Latin name for you.

And in fact, on our soil stewardship webinar, which is available on the website, we talked

about this.

One of the things I think we’ll be seeing in the coming years inside of office buildings

is a whole bunch of living plants, spider plants, and others that are particularly good

at filtering the air.

I hope we see this in people’s homes, too.

We know childhood asthma is closely related to indoor air quality issues.

And that means you’re necessarily also bringing in soil.

So think about one of the ways we can sequester carbon and make these urban rural linkages

is by having these soil installations with living plants and helping to educate and connect

the dots for people about how these things are all interrelated.

So we need to recruit individual children companies who want to come to Earth X and sell

those types of plants to the public.

Yeah, yeah.

So be great.

And design, so you have the daylight and better design standards so that you have green

building it.

Well, that’s easier.

That’s happening.

We’re starting to do that in residential and the office buildings are really going that

way towards leads and all.

But to have a plant in the space doing that works essential.

We’ve evolved to live among and within living plants and trees and forests.

And we know there’s a ton of research from the medical and psychological community plants

for five minutes, measurably reduces stress hormones.

We know it’s related to cognitive performance.

We know it’s related to quality of life.

We know it’s related to creativity and some of these things we need in our businesses and

our workplaces.

So it’s, to me, almost a no brainer in a sense.

And I think there’s probably a lot of commercial opportunities as we mobilize these kinds of

strategies.

And it means we’re all healthier and then hopefully doing even more stewardship and regenerative

work, whether it’s in real estate or some other industry.

We all get to help shape and create the future together.

One of the Earth X-lings, one of us at Earth X, Bruce, has some device that detects the

carbon footprint where it is.

So he says, in his office, in his particular office, it’s 1,000 per part for me.

And that sounds good, but he says, again, that’s not unusual at all, 1,000 partners for

We tell Dr. Oxfine down about this.

And outdoors is what, 400, 400 can enter something.

Right.

And just by way of reference for folks who may not know this right offhand, before the industrial

revolution, the carbon concentration in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million.

So now, as Tramwell’s saying, we’re over 400 parts per million.

And we’ve seen over 43% increase in carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

This is driving the climate crisis.

What’s beautiful about soil building is a 10% increase in soil carbon is the equivalent

of sequestering all of the fossil carbon we’ve released since the beginning of the industrial

revolution.

I said it again.

10% increase in soil carbon worldwide is equivalent to sequestering all of the fossil

carbon we’ve released.

So I don’t know how do I do this.

So we can get biodynamics going in the property.

There are certain plants.

We can grow their fast growing that are literally breathing in carbon from atmosphere and our

things.

We can do to them, including composting, some cases biochar, to lock that carbon back

in the ground where it belongs, we’d like to say.

Can you, can you, all the top of your head, say, what trees here in Texas, not our native

trees, but what trees?

We know that plant.

We know that plant.

We know bamboo and hemp are pretty fast growing in this area.

You got fast growing popular.

You’ve got a really beautiful forest here.

I’m just looking out the windows.

Even here at the lower level of the landscape, you could be doing a lot of comfrey, which

every fall, you would then compost.

It’s a very fast growing, it only gets a couple of few feet high, although it can get three,

four feet high.

Mine is this high in New York.

a very long time.
